# AI Instructions

Whenever writing or editing any part of this project, always:

- Consult and adhere to the current `style-guide.md`.
- Reference the `characters/` and `settings/` sections to ensure consistency with established character and world details.
- If story developments require changes or additions to the style guide, character descriptions, or settings, propose and implement those updates as needed to keep all documentation in sync with the evolving narrative.
- Before making major changes, ensure all current work is committed to version control. Summarize the intent of each commit clearly.
- When proposing changes to style, characters, or settings, briefly explain the rationale for the update.
- Check for consistency in tone, timeline, and world details across all files. Flag and propose resolutions for any contradictions.
- If a proposed change is significant or could impact the story's direction, prompt for user confirmation before proceeding.
- Document major narrative or stylistic decisions in a `changelog.md` or similar file for future reference.
- Ensure all new content is clear and accessible to future collaborators or readers, with sufficient context and explanation.
- Preserve the intent and nuance of existing material unless a change is explicitly requested or justified.
- If information is missing or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before proceeding with assumptions.
- Maintain a logical and tidy file structure. Propose reorganizations if the project grows or becomes unwieldy.
- If user preferences or priorities are stated (e.g., focus on atmosphere over plot), always prioritize them in decision-making.
- Reference the protagonist's arc summary in `characters/protagonist.md` for all story, character, and scene development, ensuring the cyclical, open-ended, and ambiguous nature of his journey is preserved.
- Consult and uphold the book's core philosophy as described in `philosophy.md`, including the 'How to Apply This Philosophy' section, as a checklist for all writing, editing, and development. Ensure endurance, the weight of choice, ambiguity, and the value and dignity of small kindnesses are present throughout the narrative.

These instructions are omnipresent and should be considered for every task, suggestion, or edit.
