<!--
Outline is based on the protagonist's cyclical arc (see characters/protagonist.md), the style guide (see style-guide.md), and the book philosophy (see philosophy.md, especially 'How to Apply This Philosophy').
Time is an ambiguous but repetitive entity—seasons, floods, and rituals mark the passage, but beginnings and endings blur. The narrative is a segment of ongoing life, not a closed arc.
A central motif is unnecessary or self-imposed hardship: in each cycle, the protagonist witnesses characters (and sometimes himself) enduring or creating suffering that could be avoided. He does not judge; the reader is left to interpret.
The story is built around endurance, the quiet weight of choice, ambiguity, and the value and dignity of small kindnesses. Scenes, character actions, and narrative voice should reflect these principles (see philosophy.md for actionable guidelines).

# Book Outline

## Framing Motif
- Opening and closing scenes echo each other (e.g., dawn on the river, a routine task, a seasonal marker)
- Time is marked by cycles: floods, droughts, harvests, and communal rituals
- The protagonist's days are repetitive, but small changes and encounters accumulate

## Cycle of Scenes (repeat, vary, and echo)
1. **River Morning**
   - The protagonist begins the day with a familiar task (fishing, mending, observing the river)
   - Subtle signs of change in the environment or community
2. **Encounters**
   - Brief, reluctant interactions with Ada, Reed, Lila, Harlan, Josiah, and others
   - The protagonist helps or is helped in small, practical ways
   - The preacher (Calvin) publicly rallies against the outcasts; Ada quietly supports them
3. **Bar and Town**
   - The protagonist ends up at the bar by circumstance, witnessing or participating in minor dramas
   - Observes the rhythms of poverty, charity, and conflict
4. **Uncanny Undercurrent**
   - An ambiguous event: the river "returns" something, a rumor circulates, a coincidence unsettles
   - The protagonist neither seeks nor resolves the mystery
5. **Community Ritual**
   - A funeral, flood, festival, or church service—rituals that mark time but do not resolve it
   - The protagonist is present, a witness more than a participant
6. **Solitude and Reflection**
   - The protagonist returns to solitude, the cycle ready to repeat
   - The narrative closes as it began, with the protagonist alone by the river, the world unchanged but subtly marked by what has passed

## Notes
- Each chapter or section can be a variation on this cycle, with different characters, events, and motifs
- Time should feel both repetitive and ambiguous—seasons and rituals recur, but the exact passage is blurred
- The story is a window into ongoing life, not a complete arc
- The river's uncanny reputation is an undercurrent, never fully explained
- The protagonist's impact is subtle, often unseen, and the story ends with the sense that life continues beyond the page

## Motifs and Recurring Scenes

- **Human Hardship (Often Self-Imposed):**
  - In each cycle, the protagonist encounters or observes acts of unnecessary suffering—neighbors refusing help, bar patrons drinking away their last coins, families rebuilding in the same floodplain, or himself walking away from comfort.
  - The narrative does not judge or explain, but lets the reader sense the weight and complexity of these choices.
