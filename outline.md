<!--
Outline is based on the protagonist's cyclical arc (see characters/protagonist.md), the style guide (see style-guide.md), and the book philosophy (see philosophy.md, especially 'How to Apply This Philosophy').
Time is an ambiguous but repetitive entity—seasons, floods, and rituals mark the passage, but beginnings and endings blur. The narrative is a segment of ongoing life, not a closed arc.
A central motif is unnecessary or self-imposed hardship: in each cycle, the protagonist witnesses characters (and sometimes himself) enduring or creating suffering that could be avoided. He does not judge; the reader is left to interpret.
The story is built around endurance, the quiet weight of choice, ambiguity, and the value and dignity of small kindnesses. Scenes, character actions, and narrative voice should reflect these principles (see philosophy.md for actionable guidelines).
Eli, the protagonist's younger self, is a recurring presence—female, almost asexual, her energy and recklessness focused on survival and escape, not romance or desire. Her actions and fate echo and challenge the protagonist throughout the narrative.
Mara, a practical, self-contained woman on the town's periphery, is a recurring but peripheral presence. She and the protagonist share a mechanical sexual encounter in unlikely circumstances, underscoring the absence of connection and the ambiguity of fulfillment. Lila and the protagonist have a history of similar, equally arbitrary encounters, which have since ceased for no particular reason.

# Book Outline

## Framing Motif
- Opening and closing scenes echo each other (e.g., dawn on the river, a routine task, a seasonal marker)
- Time is marked by cycles: floods, droughts, harvests, and communal rituals
- The protagonist's days are repetitive, but small changes and encounters accumulate
- Eli appears at key moments, her choices and risks highlighting the cost of pride and the dangers of impatience

## Cycle of Scenes (repeat, vary, and echo)
1. **River Morning**
   - The protagonist begins the day with a familiar task (fishing, mending, observing the river)
   - Subtle signs of change in the environment or community
   - Eli is glimpsed at the factory or on the river, already in motion
2. **Encounters**
   - Brief, reluctant interactions with Ada, Reed, Lila, Harlan, Josiah, Eli, Mara, and others
   - The protagonist helps or is helped in small, practical ways
   - Eli's recklessness or trouble sometimes draws the protagonist in
   - The preacher (Calvin) publicly rallies against the outcasts; Ada quietly supports them
   - Mara's presence is felt, especially in moments of mutual need or shelter
   - Lila and the protagonist's past encounters are hinted at, but have ceased
3. **Bar and Town**
   - The protagonist ends up at the bar by circumstance, witnessing or participating in minor dramas
   - Eli is often present, her actions escalating or diffusing tension
   - Observes the rhythms of poverty, charity, and conflict
4. **Uncanny Undercurrent**
   - An ambiguous event: the river "returns" something, a rumor circulates, a coincidence unsettles
   - Eli may be directly involved or affected, her fate uncertain
   - The protagonist neither seeks nor resolves the mystery
5. **Community Ritual**
   - A funeral, flood, festival, or church service—rituals that mark time but do not resolve it
   - Eli's presence is felt, sometimes disruptive, sometimes poignant
   - The protagonist is present, a witness more than a participant
6. **Solitude and Reflection**
   - The protagonist returns to solitude, the cycle ready to repeat
   - Eli's absence or fate lingers, a reminder of what is lost or endured
   - The narrative closes as it began, with the protagonist alone by the river, the world unchanged but subtly marked by what has passed

## Notes
- Each chapter or section can be a variation on this cycle, with different characters, events, and motifs
- Time should feel both repetitive and ambiguous—seasons and rituals recur, but the exact passage is blurred
- The story is a window into ongoing life, not a complete arc
- The river's uncanny reputation is an undercurrent, never fully explained
- The protagonist's impact is subtle, often unseen, and the story ends with the sense that life continues beyond the page

## Motifs and Recurring Scenes

- **Human Hardship (Often Self-Imposed):**
  - In each cycle, the protagonist encounters or observes acts of unnecessary suffering—neighbors refusing help, bar patrons drinking away their last coins, families rebuilding in the same floodplain, Eli taking reckless risks, Mara and the protagonist sharing a mechanical encounter, or the protagonist herself walking away from comfort.
  - The narrative does not judge or explain, but lets the reader sense the weight and complexity of these choices.
