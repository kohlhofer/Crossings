# Chapter 10: Last Light

Dusk settles, the river gold and gray. He sits on the dock, feet dangling above the water, the world quiet except for the call of a distant bird. The shack behind him is dark, the stove cold, the bed waiting. Bread and salt on the table, untouched.

Eli is goneâ€”no sign at the factory, no laughter on the wind. Her absence lingers, a question with no answer. The town moves on, Ada sweeping the store, Harlan closing the bar, Reed drifting past in his boat, a shadow among shadows.

He watches the sun slip behind the trees, the sky bruised and fading. The river moves, slow and indifferent, carrying branches, memories, the day itself. He stands, listens to the hush.

Night comes. He goes inside, closes the door, lies down on the narrow bed. The river breathes in the dark, the cycle ready to begin again.
