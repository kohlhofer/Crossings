# Chapter 10: Ghost-Like

The dock creaks beneath his weight. The current moves silent, marked only by leaves and debris catching light. Mud and rot fill his nose.

The boat slides from the dark, Reed's oars barely touching water. The old man's strokes come slow and steady, his face calm in the lantern light. 

Reed tilts his head. He steps into the boat. The wood rocks, finds its balance. The seat feels smooth and cold. Reed pushes off, and they slip from the dock.

They cross without words, the water lapping at hull-sides in rhythm. The lantern casts its circle against the vast dark, shadows shifting at its edge. The boat moves sure through the night, following paths Reed knows.

The far bank rises slow from black, the trees tangled overhead. Something waits there, small and strange in the mist. The shape could be person, could be stump, could be nothing. The lantern light catches movement—or shadow playing on water. Red flashes, gone.

Reed rows toward shore, oars steady. The boat scrapes mud with a soft sound. In the lantern's glow, Eli emerges from the shadows, her familiar shape becoming clear. She moves with careful steps down the muddy bank.

Boot-scrape on wet rock, then she steps into the boat with practiced ease. The craft rocks once, settles as Reed pushes off, turning downstream. A spirit-smell drifts between them, but Reed's hands stay true on oars.

The boat passes a fallen tree, its branches in water. The owls call and answer across the river. The night fills with small sounds—a turtle sliding from a log, something moving through reeds. The river carries its load—leaves, branches, an occasional bottle or cloth, all riding the current toward the sea.

Stone arches loom black above as they pass under the bridge. Their sound echoes brief against empty road.

A sound drifts over water—maybe humming, maybe river-voice rising falling. The tune sounds strange, like wind through the reeds. It stops, leaves water-murmur, starts again. Its source stays hidden in the dark.

They round a bend. A sand-spit shows in the lantern light. Reed steers through the shallows, the oars finding their way. The sand lies pale and fine, marked with night-creature tracks.

Nothing waits but driftwood and mud-smell. Marsh grass grows thick beyond, then tree-dark rises.

The water splashes shallow, sudden. Movement in the shallows catches the lantern light. Eli's shape melts into the darkness. Tobacco scent drifts faint on night air.

He raises his hand, palm open toward the darkness. A gesture small and brief, directed at her retreating form.

From the shadows comes her voice, quiet, uncertain. "Water's cold tonight." The words drift across the space between, unguarded, edge gone soft.

Reed nods once. He pushes from the sand, the boat rocking free. The old man turns downstream, the oars finding their rhythm.

He settles back in the stern. Behind them, the sand-spit fades to shadow. The water laps at hull-sides, a steady sound. Reed rows on through river-black, content in current's carry. Far off, dawn touches sky-edge pale.
