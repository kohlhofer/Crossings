# Chapter 10: The Night Crossing

Night falls heavy, the river black and wide. Stars pierce the darkness above, their light scattered on the water's surface. The air is sharp with the promise of frost, and bare branches rattle in the wind. He stands on the dock, lantern in hand, breath clouding in the cool air. The dock creaks beneath his weight, old wood settling into the night.

The air is thick with mist, carrying the scent of mud and rotting vegetation. Somewhere in the distance, a night bird calls. The river moves silently, its current invisible in the darkness, marked only by the occasional drift of leaves and debris.

Reed's boat glides out of the darkness, silent as a shadow. The old man's oars dip slow and steady, barely disturbing the water. His expression is calm and patient, his movements economical. The boat appears ghost-like in the lantern light, its hull black against the water.

Reed gestures with a tilt of his head, and he steps into the boat. The vessel rocks beneath him, finding its new balance. The wooden seat is smooth and cold. Reed pushes off with his oar, and they slip away from the dock into the black water.

They cross in silence, water lapping against the hull in a steady rhythm. The lantern casts a small circle of light around them, beyond which the world disappears into darkness. The river stretches wide here, its far bank lost in shadow and mist.

Reed rows with practiced ease, his oars cutting the water cleanly. His breathing is steady, unhurried. He knows these waters, these currents, these hidden dangers. The boat moves through the darkness like a living thing, guided by sure movements.

The far bank looms gradually out of the darkness, trees tangled, shadows deep. A figure waits there, small and indistinct in the mist. The shape might be a person, might be a stump, might be nothing at all. The lantern light catches something—movement, or perhaps just the play of shadows on water.

Reed rows toward the bank, his oars steady. The boat slides up to the muddy shore with a soft scrape. The waiting figure—if it is a figure—does not move. In the uncertain light, it could be anyone, anything, or no one at all.

He steps onto the bank, feet sinking into the soft mud. The lantern casts its circle of light, but beyond its reach, the darkness holds its secrets. A sound from the shadows—footsteps, perhaps, or the wind through the reeds. Something restless moves in the periphery of vision.

Reed pushes off from the bank, the boat rocking as it slips back into the current. He settles into the stern, and Reed turns the bow downstream. The old man rows steadily, carrying them both deeper into the night. The smell of spirits drifts faintly in the air between them, but Reed's hands remain steady on the oars.

The boat drifts past a fallen tree, its branches reaching into the water. An owl calls from somewhere in the darkness, answered by another from across the river. The night is alive with small sounds—the plop of a turtle sliding from a log, the rustle of something moving through the reeds.

Reed's oars cut through patches of foam and floating debris. The river carries its cargo downstream—leaves, branches, the occasional bottle or piece of cloth. All of it moves together in the darkness, part of the river's endless journey to the sea.

They pass under a low bridge, its stone arches dark against the sky. The sound of their passage echoes briefly, then fades. Above them, the road crosses empty and silent.

A sound drifts across the water—perhaps humming, perhaps only the river's voice rising and falling. The melody is strange, unfamiliar, like wind through reeds. Sometimes it stops, leaving only the water's murmur, then begins again. The source is uncertain, somewhere in the darkness.

The lantern flickers, its flame dancing in the night breeze. Shadows shift and move, playing tricks with the eye. He watches Reed, watches the water flow past. He speaks no words, asks no questions. The journey is enough.

They round a bend, and a spit of sand appears in the lantern light. Reed steers toward it, his oars guiding the boat through the shallow water. The sand is pale and fine, unmarked except by the tracks of raccoons and possums.

Nothing waits there but driftwood and the smell of mud. The shore is littered with river trash—bleached logs, plastic bottles, tangles of fishing line. The sand gives way to marsh grass, then to the dark line of trees beyond.

A splash from the shallows, sudden and quick. Footsteps, perhaps, or a night animal disturbed. The sound fades into the marsh grass, and the darkness swallows whatever made it.

Reed nods to him. He pushes off from the sand, the boat rocking as it slips back into the current. The old man turns the bow downstream, his oars finding their rhythm again.

He remains in the boat, settling into the stern. Reed rows steadily, carrying them both deeper into the night. The lantern light grows smaller, more fragile against the vast darkness of the river.

Behind them, the spit of sand disappears into shadow. Ahead, the river stretches endlessly, carrying them toward unknown shores. The night is thick around them, full of secrets and silence, and the world remains unchanged.

Water laps against the hull, a steady sound. Reed rows on, tireless, his face calm in the lantern light. He watches the darkness flow past, content to be carried by the current, by the night, by the patient water. In the distance, the first hint of dawn touches the horizon.
