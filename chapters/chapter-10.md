# Chapter 10: Ghost-Like

Night falls heavy, the river black and wide. Stars pierce the darkness above, scattered light on water. The air carries frost's edge, and bare branches rattle. He stands on the dock, lantern in hand, breath clouding. The dock creaks beneath his weight.

Mist thickens the air. Mud and rot fill his nose. A night bird calls. The river moves silent, current marked only by leaves and debris catching light.

Reed's boat slides from darkness, oars barely touching water. The old man's strokes come slow and steady. His face stays calm in lantern light, movements spare. The boat emerges black against black water.

Reed tilts his head. He steps into the boat. Wood rocks, finds balance. The seat feels smooth and cold. Reed pushes off, and they slip from the dock.

They cross without words, water lapping hull-sides in rhythm. The lantern casts its circle, beyond which all fades to black. The far bank vanishes in shadow and mist.

Reed rows with practice, oars cutting clean. His breathing stays even. The boat moves sure through darkness, following paths Reed knows.

The far bank rises slow from black, trees tangled overhead. Something waits there, small and strange in mist. The shape could be person, could be stump, could be nothing. Lantern light catches movement—or shadow playing on water. Red flashes, gone.

Reed rows toward shore, oars steady. The boat scrapes mud with a soft sound. In the lantern's glow, Eli emerges from the shadows, her familiar shape becoming clear. She moves with careful steps down the muddy bank.

Boot-scrape on wet rock, then she steps into the boat, finding her balance with practiced ease. The craft rocks once, settles. Reed pushes off, turning downstream, and she settles in the stern. Spirit-smell drifts between them, but Reed's hands stay true on oars.

The boat passes a fallen tree, branches in water. Owls call and answer across the river. Night fills with small sounds—turtle sliding from log, something moving through reeds.

Reed's oars cut foam and floating things. The river carries its load—leaves, branches, occasional bottle or cloth. All moves together in dark, riding current toward sea.

They pass under the bridge, stone arches black above. Their sound echoes brief, fades. The road crosses empty overhead.

A sound drifts over water—maybe humming, maybe river-voice rising falling. The tune sounds strange, like wind through reeds. It stops, leaves water-murmur, starts again. Its source stays hidden in dark.

The lantern flickers in night wind. Shadows shift and dance. He watches Reed, watches water flow. No words pass between them.

They round a bend. A sand-spit shows in lantern light. Reed steers through shallows, oars finding way. The sand lies pale and fine, marked with night-creature tracks.

Nothing waits but driftwood and mud-smell. Marsh grass grows thick beyond, then tree-dark rises.

Water splashes shallow, sudden. Movement in the shallows catches the lantern light. The sound dies. Eli's shape melts into the darkness. Tobacco scent drifts faint on night air.

He raises his hand, palm open toward darkness. A gesture small and brief, directed at her retreating form.

From shadows comes her voice, quiet, uncertain. "Water's cold tonight." Words drift across space between, unguarded, edge gone soft.

Reed nods once. He pushes from sand, boat rocking free. The old man turns downstream, oars finding rhythm.

He settles back in the stern. Reed rows steady through dark. The lantern light shrinks against vast river-black.

Behind them, sand-spit fades to shadow. Ahead, the river stretches endless. Night holds thick around them, full of silence, and nothing changes.

Water laps hull-sides, steady sound. Reed rows on, face calm in lantern light. He watches darkness flow past, content in current's carry. Far off, dawn touches sky-edge pale.
