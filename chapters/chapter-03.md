# Chapter 3: The Bell's Echo

The bell rings, cracked and uncertain, its sound drifting over the rooftops. He hears it from the riverbank, a dull summons that carries across the water. The bell is old, its bronze green with age. He keeps walking, boots scraping the packed dirt, the sound trailing him, then growing.

The path bends toward the square, dust rising with each step. The church stands at the edge of the square, white paint peeling like old skin, steeple leaning slightly to the left. The building is weathered, its foundation cracked, its windows clouded with years of rain and sun. A sign by the door reads "All Welcome" in faded letters.

People gather in twos and threes, heads bowed, voices low. The women wear their best dresses, faded but clean, their hair pinned back. The men carry worn Bibles, their shoes polished despite the scuffs. Children fidget beside their parents, tugging at starched collars and ribbon ties.

He does not join them. He stands apart, watching as Brother Calvin greets each arrival with a practiced smile, collar askew, voice loud in the morning air. Calvin is a big man, thick around the middle, his face flushed with heat and conviction. His handshake is firm, his gaze intense, his words quick and certain.

"Sister Mary, good to see you. The Lord's grace shines on you this morning."

"Brother Tom, how's the family? The Lord provides, doesn't He?"

The congregation files inside, shoes scraping the steps, hymnals clutched tight. The mother from the store is there, her child beside her, both wearing dresses that have been let out and taken in. Ada nods to them as she passes, her own dress simple but well-kept.

Inside, the hymns beginâ€”off-key, slow, the words familiar. Through the open door, he catches fragments of song, voices raised in hope or habit. The piano is out of tune, its keys yellow with age, its sound thin in the morning air. The congregation sings with more effort than joy.

Brother Calvin's voice rises above the rest, calling for prayer. The people bow their heads, some with eyes closed, some with eyes on the floor. Calvin prays for the community, for the harvest, for the souls of those who have strayed. His voice carries through the open door, rich and rolling, practiced in its cadence.

"Lord, we ask for Your blessing on this community, on these faithful souls who gather in Your name. Watch over our neighbors, those who struggle with pride and sin, those who turn away from Your light. Guard us from the temptations that lead us astray, from the paths that divide us from righteousness."

The words drift out into the morning air, mixing with the sound of insects and the distant call of a train. He leans against the fence, watching the building, listening to the ritual inside. A dog wanders past, sniffing at the church steps, then moving on.

The service continues, Calvin's voice rising and falling like the tide. He speaks of sin and redemption, of the river's memory and God's judgment. The congregation responds with murmurs of agreement, their voices soft and weary. Some shift in their seats, others fan themselves with hymnals. His words drift toward themes of community order, of proper conduct, of the dangers of charity without wisdom.

Through the door, he can see the backs of heads, the bent shoulders of people seeking comfort or answers. The pews are not full, but those who come do so with purpose. Mrs. Ada Bell sits near the front, her back straight, her attention fixed on Calvin's words. The mother from the store sits near the back, her child beside her, both quiet and still.

A woman weeps quietly on the steps, her shoulders shaking with each sob. Her dress is patched at the elbows, her shoes worn thin. She holds a handkerchief to her face, trying to muffle the sound. She sits alone on the step, her grief a private thing.

He watches from the fence. The woman's pain is visible, but its source remains hidden. The service continues inside, Calvin's voice steady.

The hymns resume, voices joining in song that speaks of hope and salvation. The melody is familiar, the words worn smooth by repetition. The congregation sings with determination, their voices carrying across the square, past the stores and houses, toward the river.

The sun climbs higher, the bell's echo fading into memory. The service draws to its close, Calvin's final prayer echoing through the open door. The people inside begin to stir, gathering their belongings, preparing for the return to their daily lives.

The doors open, and the congregation spills out, blinking in the bright light. They move slowly, reluctantly. Calvin stands at the door, shaking hands, offering final words of encouragement or advice.

"God bless you, Sister. Remember what we talked about."

"See you next week, Brother. The Lord's work continues."

The people disperse, walking back to their homes, their farms, their daily struggles. The weeping woman has composed herself, clutching her handkerchief. She walks away alone, her steps careful, her head down.

Ada returns to the building, helping to stack hymnals, to straighten pews. She moves with quiet efficiency, her service continuing beyond the formal worship. Calvin moves through the church, closing windows, adjusting chairs. Their paths cross near the altar. A moment of proximity, nothing more, but she steps aside, maintains distance. Her movements remain careful, measured.

He pushes away from the fence, the square emptying, the church settling back into quiet. The service is over, its echoes lingering in the air.

He turns away, the sound of the river louder now, the church behind him, the day moving on. His boots scrape the packed dirt, the dust rising with each step. The path leads back to the river, to the dock, to the fishing line that waits in the brown water.

Behind him, the church stands empty, its doors closed, its bell silent. The square is quiet, the morning sun casting long shadows across the dirt.
