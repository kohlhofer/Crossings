# Chapter 3: The Bell's Echo

The bell rings, cracked and uncertain, its sound drifting over the rooftops. He hears it from the riverbank, a dull summons. The church stands at the edge of the square, white paint peeling, steeple leaning. People gather in twos and threes, heads bowed, voices low.

He does not join them. He stands apart, watching as Brother Calvin greets each arrival with a practiced smile, collar askew, voice loud in the morning air. The congregation files inside, shoes scraping the steps, hymnals clutched tight. Eli is not among them. Sometimes she is seen at the back, but not today.

Inside, the hymns beginâ€”off-key, slow, the words familiar but hollow. Through the open door, he catches a fragment of prayer, a warning about sin and the river's memory. Calvin's voice rises, then falls. The people listen, some with eyes closed, some with eyes on the floor.

He waits outside, leaning against the fence. The sun climbs higher, the bell's echo fading. A woman weeps quietly on the steps, Ada sits beside her, hand on her shoulder. The service ends. People spill out, blinking in the light, their burdens unchanged.

He turns away, the sound of the river louder now, the church behind him, the day moving on.
