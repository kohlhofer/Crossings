# Chapter 3: All Welcome

The bell rings, cracked and uncertain, its sound drifting over the rooftops. He hears it from the path toward town, a dull summons that carries across the water. He keeps walking, dust rising with each step, headed for the mill road where work might be found.

The church stands at the edge of the square, white paint peeling like old skin, steeple leaning slightly to the left. The building is weathered, its foundation cracked, its windows clouded with years of rain and sun. A sign by the door reads "All Welcome" in faded letters. Morning shadows stretch across the ground, and the air is cool with the promise of heat to come. Cicadas drone in the oak trees, their song rising and falling like breath.

People gather in twos and threes, heads bowed, voices low. Faded but clean, the women wear their best dresses, hair pinned back. The men carry worn Bibles, their shoes polished despite the scuffs. Children fidget beside their parents, tugging at starched collars and ribbon ties.

He slows his pace, then stops, standing apart as Brother Calvin greets each arrival with a practiced smile, collar askew, voice loud in the morning air. Calvin is a big man, thick around the middle, his face flushed with heat and conviction. His handshake is firm, his gaze intense, his words quick and certain. His gaze rests a beat too long on each younger woman, the smile deepening just slightly before returning to its practiced warmth.

"Mary, good to see you. Blessed morning."

"Tom, how's the family? The Lord provides."

The congregation files inside, shoes scraping the steps, hymnals clutched tight. The mother from the store is there, her child beside her, both wearing dresses that have been let out and taken in. As she passes, Ada nods to them, her own dress simple but well-kept.

Inside, the hymns begin—off-key, slow, the words familiar. Through the open door, he catches fragments of song, voices raised in hope or habit. The piano is out of tune, its keys yellow with age, its sound thin in the morning air. The congregation sings with more effort than joy.

Brother Calvin's voice rises above the rest, calling for prayer. Heads bow. Some eyes close, others fix on the floor. Calvin prays for the community, for the harvest, for the souls of those who have strayed. His voice carries through the open door, rich and rolling, practiced in its cadence.

"Lord, we ask for Your blessing on this community, on these faithful souls who gather in Your name. Watch over our neighbors, those who struggle with pride and sin, those who turn away from Your light. Guard us from the temptations that lead us astray, from the paths that divide us from righteousness."

The words mix with insect buzz and a train's distant whistle. He leans against the fence. A dog sniffs at the church steps, moves on.

Calvin's voice rises and falls. He speaks of sin and redemption, of the river's memory and God's judgment. Murmurs of agreement answer him, soft and weary. Bodies shift in pews. Hymnals fan hot air. His words turn to community order, proper conduct, the dangers of charity without wisdom.

Through the door, rows of bent shoulders, bowed heads. The pews hold gaps, but those present sit with purpose. Mrs. Ada Bell near the front, spine straight, eyes on Calvin. The mother from the store in back, her child beside her, both still as stone.

A woman weeps quietly on the steps, her shoulders shaking with each sob. Her dress is patched at the elbows, her shoes worn thin. She holds a handkerchief to her face, trying to muffle the sound. She sits alone on the step.

He watches from the fence. The service continues inside, Calvin's voice steady.

The hymns resume, voices joining in song that speaks of hope and salvation. The melody is familiar, the words worn smooth by repetition. The congregation sings with determination, their voices carrying across the square, past the stores and houses, toward the river.

The sun climbs higher, the bell's echo fading into memory. The service draws to its close, Calvin's final prayer echoing through the open door. The people inside begin to stir, gather their belongings.

The congregation spills out, blinking in the bright light. They move slowly, reluctantly. Calvin stands at the door, shaking hands, offering final words of encouragement or advice.

"God bless you. Remember what we talked about."

"Next week, then. The Lord's work continues."

The people disperse, walking back to their homes, their farms, their daily struggles. The weeping woman has composed herself, clutching her handkerchief. She walks away alone, her steps careful, her head down.

Ada lingers after the others leave, moving through the empty pews to stack hymnals and straighten cushions. She works with quiet efficiency, her service continuing beyond the worship. Calvin moves through the church, closing windows, adjusting chairs. Their paths cross near the altar. A moment of proximity, nothing more, but she steps aside, maintains distance. Her movements remain careful, measured. When a hymnal slips from her hands, she retrieves it quickly, avoiding his eyes. The efficiency masks the tremor in her fingers.

He pauses beside her, sets down a small wrapped bundle on the altar rail. "For the poor box," he says quietly. She nods, does not look at the bundle, but her hand brushes his as she reaches for another hymnal. The touch is brief, deliberate. She picks up the bundle, unwraps it partially—fabric, blue and worn soft. She wraps it again, places it carefully aside. "I'll see it gets where it needs to go," she says, voice barely above a whisper.

He pushes away from the fence, the square emptying, the church settling back into quiet. The service is over, its echoes lingering in the air.

He turns toward the creek where it meets the river. Behind him, the church stands empty, doors closed, bell silent. Ahead, through the trees, the mill wheel turns, its steady rhythm a different kind of sermon.
