# Chapter 5: The Bar's Shadow

The house sags at the edge of town, porch littered with bottles and broken chairs. He steps inside, air thick with sweat and cheap spirits. Lila sits in the corner, faded dress, suitcase at her feet. Amos hunched at the bar, muttering to himself, eyes on the floor. Harlan asleep behind the counter, roused only when someone calls his name.

He takes a seat, back to the wall. Lila laughs, sharp and sudden, breaking the hush. Amos grumbles, knocks over his mug, curses the world. Eli slips in, hair damp, eyes bright, restless. She leans against the wall, watching, waiting for something to happen.

A fight starts, quick and pointlessâ€”two men, both drunk, both desperate. Harlan wakes, sighs, tells someone else to break it up. Lila sings a line of an old song, voice rough, words lost in the noise. Eli slips out, gone before anyone notices.

He sits, silent, watching the room spin around him. He leaves before dark, the sound of laughter and argument fading behind him. The river waits, unchanged.
