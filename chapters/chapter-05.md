# Chapter 5: The Bar's Shadow

The house sags at the edge of town, porch littered with bottles and broken chairs. He doesn't mean to go in. Eli is ahead, hands in her pockets, shoulders hunched against the wind. She glances back once, waits at the door. He follows, not thinking, just moving out of the cold. By the time he steps inside, she's gone—vanished into the gray, as if she was never there.

Inside, the air is thick with sweat and cheap spirits. Lila sits in the corner, faded dress, suitcase at her feet, humming to herself. Amos hunched at the bar, muttering, eyes on the floor. Harlan asleep behind the counter, roused only when someone calls his name.

"You're late," Amos says, not looking up.

"Always late," Lila echoes, voice flat, as if reciting a line from a play.

Harlan grunts, half-awake. "He's always late, but he always comes."

The words drift through the room, worn smooth by repetition. No one expects an answer.

A man slumps at a table near the door, head in his hands.

He takes a seat, back to the wall. Lila laughs, sharp and sudden, breaking the hush. Amos grumbles, knocks over his mug, curses the world.

Eli slips in, hair damp, eyes bright, restless. She leans against the wall, watching, waiting for something to happen.

Amos slides a glass across the bar, liquid dark and nameless. He drinks, the taste sharp, unfamiliar.

The door creaks open. Another man steps in, shoulders hunched, eyes scanning the room. He mutters something, ignored. Moves to the bar, words slurred, voice too loud. Amos grunts, turns away. Lila hums a tune, off-key, lost in her own world. Harlan stirs, then settles back into sleep.

The newcomer stands for a moment, then drifts toward the table by the door. The first man looks up, eyes red, jaw tight. A word, a shove, a chair scraping the floor. The fight starts, quick and pointless—two men, both drunk, near the entrance. Harlan wakes, sighs, tells someone else to break it up. Lila sings a line of an old song, voice rough, words lost in the noise. Eli slips out, gone before anyone notices.

Another glass appears, pushed his way. He drinks again, the burn settling in his chest.

He leaves before dark, the sound of laughter and argument fading behind him. The river waits, unchanged.
