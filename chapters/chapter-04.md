# Chapter 4: River Drift

Mist clings to the water, blurring the far bank. He pushes the boat from the dock, oar dipping, river slow and heavy beneath him. The current carries him past the factory—windows broken, walls streaked with rust. Laughter rings out, sharp in the morning air. A figure climbs the girders, quick and fearless, vanishing and reappearing in the mist.

He rows in silence, the river wide and brown, reeds brushing the hull. A heron lifts, wings beating slow, vanishing into the fog. He drifts, lets the current decide. The world narrows to water, wood, and breath.

Reed appears, boat gliding from the shadows. They pass close, eyes meeting for a moment. No words. Reed’s boat is piled with nets, a coil of rope, a battered oar. He nods, moves on, swallowed by mist.

A figure leaps from the factory roof, lands hard, rolls, stands. A wave, a flash of hand, then gone, running along the river’s edge. He watches, a line of energy against the gray. The river moves on, indifferent.

He lets the boat drift, the oar resting across his knees. The day opens, slow and uncertain, the river carrying him nowhere in particular.
