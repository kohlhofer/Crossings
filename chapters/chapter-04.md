# Chapter 4: River Drift

Mist clings to the water, blurring the far bank. He pushes the boat from the dock, oar dipping, river slow and heavy beneath him. The boat is old, its wood soft with age, its bottom scarred and stained. Water seeps through the gaps, pooling around his feet, but it holds. It floats.

The current carries him past the factoryâ€”windows broken, walls streaked with rust. The building looms through the mist, its skeleton of steel and iron dark against the gray sky. Laughter rings out, sharp in the morning air, echoing off the water. A figure climbs the girders, quick and fearless, vanishing and reappearing in the mist.

He watches as the figure moves through the structure, leaping from beam to beam. The movements are fluid, confident. The figure pauses at the top, arms spread wide, then disappears into the maze of metal and shadow.

He rows in silence, the river wide and brown, reeds brushing the hull. The water tastes of mud and rain, of upstream storms and downstream mysteries. A heron lifts from the shallows, wings beating slow, vanishing into the fog. Its cry echoes across the water, lonely and wild.

The oar cuts through the surface, disturbing the reflection of sky and mist. He drifts, lets the current decide. The world narrows to water, wood, and breath. The river bottom is invisible, lost in brown depths that could be three feet or thirty.

A fish jumps, silver flash in the brown water, then gone. Ripples spread outward, catching the light, then fading. He considers the fishing line coiled in the bottom of the boat, the hooks wrapped in cloth, but does not reach for them. The river will give what it gives.

Reed appears, boat gliding from the shadows like a ghost made solid. They pass close, eyes meeting for a moment. No words. Reed's boat is piled with nets, a coil of rope, a battered oar. His face is weathered, his hands cracked from rope and water. He nods, moves on, swallowed by mist.

Reed's boat leaves a small wake, gentle waves that rock his vessel. The old man's movements are economical, practiced. He knows these waters, these currents, these moods of the river. His nets are mended and re-mended, his boat patched but seaworthy.

A figure appears on the riverbank, moving quick and sure. A wave, a flash of hand, then gone, running along the river's edge. He watches, a line of energy against the gray. The figure moves with purpose, following the water's edge, disappearing into the trees.

The river moves on, indifferent. A turtle surfaces, head breaking the water, eyes dark and ancient. It watches the boat pass, then sinks back into the depths. The mist begins to lift, revealing more of the far shore, more of the factory's broken windows.

He lets the boat drift, the oar resting across his knees. The wood is warm from his hands, smooth and worn. The day opens, slow and uncertain, the river carrying him nowhere in particular. A crow calls from the trees, its voice harsh in the morning air.

The factory grows smaller behind him, its broken windows dark. The figure is gone, but their presence lingers in the disturbed air, in the echo of laughter off the water. The river curves ahead, bending toward unknown shores, carrying him deeper into the morning.

Water laps against the hull, a steady rhythm that matches his breathing. The boat moves with the current, following the river's path. He does not fight it, does not try to direct its course.

A kingfisher dives, emerging with a fish in its beak. It flies to a dead branch, shakes its catch, then swallows it whole.

The mist thickens, then thins, revealing glimpses of the shore. An old tire hangs from a tree, a rope swing left by children. A dock extends into the water, its boards green with moss. Life continues along the river's edge, marked by small signs of human presence.

He passes a sandbar, its surface dotted with the tracks of raccoons and possums. The water is shallower here, clearer, revealing the bottom strewn with rocks and fallen branches. A snake sunbathes on a log, its scales catching the filtered light.

The boat drifts on, following the river's lazy curve. He sits in the stern, oar across his knees, watching the world pass by. The water carries him forward, toward whatever the day will bring.

Behind him, the factory disappears into the mist, its mysteries intact. The figure is gone, but their energy remains in the disturbed air, in the echo of laughter off the water.

The river stretches ahead, brown and slow, carrying leaves and debris downstream. He drifts with it, carried by the current downstream.
