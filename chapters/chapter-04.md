# Chapter 4: Everything's Gone

The wheel turns in the current, wooden spokes dark with water. The mill sits upstream on the creek before it meets river, stone foundation green with moss, walls weathered gray. Water flows steady through the wheel's channels, driving the mechanism within.

He walks the path beside the creek, boots squelching in the mud. The miller sometimes has work—heavy sacks, small repairs, tasks that might pay in coins rather than credit. The work comes and goes, depending on the miller's mood and the season's demands.

The mill door stands open, flour dust dancing in the morning light. Inside, the great stones turn, their grinding filling the air with a sound. The miller stands beside the mechanism, his thick hands checking the flow of grain, his movements practiced and sure.

"Need something?" the miller asks without looking up. His voice carries over the grinding stones, rough as the grain itself. He is a large man, thick through the chest and shoulders, his hair gray and thinning. His hands are permanently stained with flour, his clothes dusted white.

"Work," he says. "If there's any."

The miller glances at him, considers. "Henderson's sack needs delivering. And the store." He jerks his head toward the door. "Cart's outside."

Each sack waits by the door, marked with a name, a weight, a price. He lifts them one by one, muscles tensing against the weight of grain. His stomach contracts with emptiness, but his hands remain steady. The miller watches, counting, making marks in a ledger with a stub of pencil.

"Mind the Henderson sack," the miller says. "They'll complain either way."

Mara appears in the doorway that leads to the mill house, her movements careful, deliberate. She carries a tray—bread, cheese, a cup of water. Her dress is simple, faded blue, her hair pulled back severe. She shows tiredness that comes from years, not days. She sets the tray on the miller's table without meeting his eyes.

"About time," the miller says, his voice different now. Sharper. "Where's the butter?"

She sets down an empty butter crock, its sides scraped clean. "Gone," she says quietly.

The miller's jaw tightens. "Gone." He repeats the word like it tastes bad. "Everything's always gone with you."

She does not argue, does not explain. She stands beside the table, hands folded, eyes on the floor. The wheel turns, grinding grain, filling the silence.

"Get more," the miller says. "And mind the cost."

She nods, turns to go. The miller watches her walk away, his expression unreadable. When she disappears into the house, he returns to his ledger, his pencil moving across the page.

The deliveries are quick—Henderson's farm, then Ada's store. Mrs. Henderson checks the sack, counts out payment with careful fingers. Ada runs the flour through her fingers, testing its quality. "Good flour," she says. "Tell him I said so."

The sun rides higher as he pushes the empty cart back to the mill. The miller waits, counting coins twice, making marks. "Two bits," he says, pressing the coins into his palm. "Come back next week. Might have something."

The coins are cold, few, real. He pockets them, nods, turns to go. In the doorway to the mill house, Mara appears again, like a shadow at the edge of sight. She watches him leave, her expression unreadable. He nods to her. She does not respond, but something in her posture softens.

The path back to the river lies quiet. Behind him, the mill wheel turns, grinding grain, marking time. The sound fades as he walks.

At the river, afternoon shadows stretch across the dock. The water moves past, brown and slow, carrying its burden of silt and debris. He checks his fishing line, empty as always. The coins make a small sound when he moves.
