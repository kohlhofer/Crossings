# Chapter 11: Downstream

First light bleeds into the river, the water still dark but softening to gray. He sits on the dock, feet dangling above the surface, watching night retreat. The stillness of early morning holds, broken only by an early bird's call across the water.

The shack behind him stands silent, its windows catching the first pale light. The stove is cold, its ashes settled. The bed lies untouched, narrow and waiting. On the table, bread and salt sit undisturbed, provisions for when hunger returns.

A train whistle sounds in the distance. The sound drifts across the water, then fades to the soft lap of waves against the dock. A fish jumps, rings spreading outward, disappearing into the current.

He watches darkness lift from the empty factory across the river. The building emerges slowly, its broken windows beginning to catch light. The girders stand stark against the lightening sky, still holding the shadows of those who climb through the ruins.

A moment passes. His hand lifts slightly from his knee, then settles back.

The sky shifts from black to deep blue, then to pearl gray, clouds catching the first hint of sun. Early swallows dive for insects above the water, their cries sharp in the dawn air. A heron stands motionless in the shallows, already at its morning vigil.

The river moves, slow and indifferent, carrying branches, leaves, the night's debris. A bottle bobs past, then a piece of wood worn smooth by water. Something red catches on the dock post—fabric, faded and torn, freed from whatever held it upstream. All flows downstream, toward the sea.

The air stays cool with night's remnants, carrying the scent of mud and dew-wet grass. Mist clings to the water's surface, thin wisps rising and dissolving. A dog barks somewhere in the sleeping town, then falls silent. The wind picks up, stirring the moisture-heavy leaves of the cottonwoods.

He stands, brushes dirt from his pants, listens to the hush over the water. The dock creaks beneath his feet, old wood still holding night's chill. He checks the fishing line—still empty, hook clean and waiting.

The path to the shack is damp with morning dew. He walks slowly, in no hurry to reach the door. The dawn fills with small sounds and retreating shadows.

Inside, the shack smells of old wood and river air. Pale light finds its way through the windows now, no lamp needed. The mirror above the basin reflects his face—stubble, weathered skin, gray eyes. Cold water against his face washes away the night.

The coffee tin sits on the shelf, coins making their thin sound as he counts them. Enough for today. 

From the window, he watches the river brighten slowly, its surface textured by strengthening light. The factory emerges fully now.

Somewhere across the water, smoke rises—thin and blue against the morning sky, then disappears into the growing light.

He sits on the edge of the bed, removes his boots, sets them beside the door. The floor cool beneath his feet. Outside, the river continues its flow, carrying the night downstream.

An owl makes its last call from the trees as morning birds begin their chorus. Night hunters yield to day's creatures. He lies down on the narrow bed, pulls the thin blanket over him.

The chickens begin to stir in their coop. The shack creaks, wood warming in the morning air. The line hangs in the current, steady and waiting.
