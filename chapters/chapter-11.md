# Chapter 11: Downstream

First light bleeds into the river, the water still dark but softening to gray. He sits on the dock, feet dangling above the surface, watching night retreat. The world holds the quiet of false dawn, broken only by the call of an early bird, its voice carrying across the water.

The shack behind him stands silent, its windows catching the first pale light. The stove is cold, its ashes settled. The bed lies untouched, narrow and waiting. On the table, bread and salt sit undisturbed, provisions for when hunger returns.

A train whistle sounds in the distance, too early for the morning run. The sound drifts across the water, then fades, leaving only the soft lap of waves against the dock. A fish jumps, rings spreading outward, then disappearing into the current.

He watches darkness lift from the empty factory across the river. The building emerges slowly from night, its broken windows beginning to catch the growing light. The girders stand stark against the lightening sky, still holding the shadows of those who climb through the ruins.

A moment passes. His hand lifts slightly from his knee, then settles back.

The sky shifts from black to deep blue, then to pearl gray, clouds catching the first hint of sun. Early swallows dive for insects above the water, their cries sharp in the dawn air. A heron stands motionless in the shallows, already at its morning vigil.

The river moves, slow and indifferent, carrying branches, leaves, the night's debris. A bottle bobs past, then a piece of wood worn smooth by water. Something red catches on the dock post—fabric, faded and torn, freed from whatever held it upstream. All of it flows downstream, toward the sea, part of the river's endless cargo.

The air stays cool with night's remnants, carrying the scent of mud and dew-wet grass. Mist clings to the water's surface, thin wisps rising and dissolving. The last fireflies blink out in the grass as their night watch ends. A dog barks somewhere in the sleeping town, then falls silent. The wind picks up, stirring the moisture-heavy leaves of the cottonwood trees.

He stands, brushes dirt from his pants, listens to the hush that lingers over the water. The dock creaks beneath his feet, old wood still holding night's chill. He checks the fishing line one more time—still empty, hook clean and waiting.

The path to the shack is worn smooth, the earth damp with morning dew. He walks slowly, in no hurry to reach the door. The dawn is peaceful, full of small sounds and retreating shadows.

Inside, the shack smells of old wood and river air. He doesn't need the lamp now, pale light finding its way through the windows. The mirror above the basin reflects his face—stubble, weathered skin, gray eyes. Cold water against his face as he washes away the night.

The coffee tin sits on the shelf, coins making their thin sound when he counts them. Enough for today. Fishhooks and line fill the mason jar, tools of his trade. The coil of net waits for mending, its gaps patient for his attention.

He moves to the window, looks out at the river. The water brightens slowly, its surface textured by the strengthening light. The factory emerges fully now, its mysteries changing with the day.

Somewhere across the water, smoke rises—thin and blue against the morning sky, then disappears into the growing light.

He sits on the edge of the bed, removes his boots, sets them beside the door. Cool beneath his feet, the floor. Outside, the river continues its flow, carrying the night downstream.

An owl makes its last call from the trees, while morning birds begin their chorus. Night hunters yield to day's creatures. He lies down on the narrow bed, pulls the thin blanket over him. The pillow is flat, the mattress hard. Through the window, early light catches on the water, turning darkness to silver.

The chickens begin to stir in their coop. The shack creaks, wood warming in the morning air. The line hangs in the current, steady and waiting.
