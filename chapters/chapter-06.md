# Chapter 6: Shelter

Rain falls hard, drumming on the tin roof. He finds shelter in an empty shed behind the mill, darkness thick, air heavy with the smell of wet earth and oil. Mara is already there, sitting on a crate, arms folded, eyes on the door. She nods, makes room. No words.

Lightning flashes, the world white for a moment. They sit in silence, listening to the storm. Hunger, fatigue, the ache of another day. She stands, moves closer, her movements practical, unhurried. He does not resist. The act is wordless, mechanical, a brief joining of bodies for warmth, for need, for nothing more.

After, she dresses, sits back on the crate. He buttons his shirt, stares at the floor. The rain slows. She leaves first, slipping into the night without a backward glance. He waits, listens to the last drops on the roof, then steps out into the wet grass. The world is unchanged. The river still runs, unseen in the dark.
