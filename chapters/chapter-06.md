# Chapter 6: My Chair

The bar sags at the edge of town, porch littered with bottles and broken chairs. The paint is gone, leaving weathered wood gray and worn. A sign hangs crooked by the door, letters too faded to read. He doesn't mean to go in.

Eli is ahead, hands in her pockets, shoulders hunched against the evening breeze. She glances back once, waits at the door. He follows, not thinking.

Inside, the air is thick with sweat and cheap spirits. Floorboards creak under his weight, sticky with spilled drinks. A single bulb hangs from the ceiling, casting harsh shadows.

Eli pushes through to the bar, coins already in her hand. She slaps them down, metal ringing against wood. "Two," she says to Harlan. Her jacket hangs loose—sleeves rolled back, thin wrists marked with old scratches, shoulder held together by a safety pin.

Lila sits in her corner, suitcase at her feet. Her dress hangs loose, her hair unwashed, her eyes shifting between vacant and sharp as Harlan's attention wanders. She hums broken melodies, the suitcase's brass fittings as tarnished as her voice.

Amos hunches at the bar, muttering with eyes on the floor. His clothes are stained, his beard unkempt, fingers wrapped white-knuckled around his mug. A wedding ring catches the light—the only clean thing about him. His words emerge only when he thinks himself unheard.

Behind the counter, Harlan dozes beside a half-empty bottle, his ledger open beneath one heavy hand. The proprietor's belly strains against his shirt, his breathing thick with sleep.

"Late," Amos mutters, not looking up. His voice is slurred, his words directed at the floor.

"Always," Lila echoes, voice flat.

Harlan grunts, half-awake. "Always comes."

The words drift through the room, worn smooth by repetition. No one expects an answer. He moves to the bar, finds an empty stool at the far end. The wood is worn smooth, stained with rings from countless glasses. He sits carefully, back to the wall, watching the room.

A man slumps at a table near the door, head in his hands. A bottle sits empty before him, its label peeled away. His clothes are clean but wrinkled, his shoes polished but worn. He looks up once, eyes red, then returns to staring at the table. The miller. 

Lila laughs, sharp and sudden, breaking the hush. The sound cuts through the room. Amos grumbles, knocks over his mug, curses the world. Beer spreads across the bar, dripping onto the floor. Harlan stirs, looks at the mess, then settles back.

Eli tosses back her drink, sets the glass down hard. The second glass sits untouched beside her elbow. She spins on her stool, eyes bright and restless.

A glass slides his way, liquid dark and nameless. He drinks without asking, the burn settling in his chest.

A man enters, moves toward the table where the miller sits. "My chair," comes the growl, flour still dusting the sleeves. The newcomer sits anyway. They collide like broken machinery—gears that no longer mesh. Hands grab air, feet stumble on nothing.

"Outside," Harlan says.

"Down in the valley, the valley so low," Lila sings.

The fight dies quickly. The miller retreats to the bar, muttering about respect. The other man finds a different corner, nursing his lip.

Eli slides the untouched glass toward him. He shakes his head. She shrugs, drinks it herself. "Waste nothing," she says, words sharp as the safety pin in her jacket.

The room fills and empties. A woman enters, finds no welcome, leaves. The door's slam shakes the windows. Harlan mutters about the damp.

He watches the parade of nowhere people, saying nothing. They drink because it helps, or because it doesn't matter.

Eli stands abruptly, fishing more coins from her pocket. She counts them in her palm, then laughs at what she sees. "Easy come," she says to no one. She heads for the door, but stops, turns back. "River's not frozen yet." Her eyes are bright with something—alcohol, mischief, or both. She disappears into the dim evening air.

The night deepens. Lila's song turns strange, Amos speaks secrets to the floor. Faces blur as glasses empty and refill, marking time in liquid measures.
