# Chapter 6: My Chair

The bar sags at the edge of town, porch littered with bottles and broken chairs. The paint is gone, leaving weathered wood gray and worn. A sign hangs crooked by the door, letters too faded to read. He doesn't mean to go in.

Eli is ahead, hands in her pockets, shoulders hunched against the evenig breeze. She moves with purpose, her steps quick on the broken porch boards. She glances back once, waits at the door. He follows, not thinking.

Inside, the air is thick with sweat and cheap spirits. The smell hits him first—stale beer, unwashed bodies, smoke from cigarettes rolled too thin. Floorboards creak under his weight, sticky with spilled drinks. A single bulb hangs from the ceiling, casting harsh shadows that make faces hard to read.

Eli pushes through to the bar, coins already in her hand. She slaps them down, metal ringing against wood. "Two," she says to Harlan, voice carrying over the noise. Her jacket is too big, sleeves rolled back, revealing thin wrists marked with old scratches. A safety pin holds the shoulder seam together.

In the corner, Lila sits with faded dress hanging loose on her thin frame, suitcase at her feet, humming to herself. Her hair is unwashed, her eyes unfocused. The suitcase is old, its leather cracked, its brass fittings tarnished. She rocks slightly as she hums. When Harlan's not looking, her eyes sharpen, tracking who enters, who leaves, who has money. The vacant humming resumes the moment his attention returns.

Hunched at the bar, Amos mutters with eyes on the floor. His clothes are stained, his beard unkempt. His fingers wrap around a mug, knuckles white with the effort of holding on. He speaks to no one, his words lost in the noise of the room. A wedding ring, bright with polish, catches the light on his finger—the only clean thing about him. When someone approaches, his muttering stops, replaced by sullen silence. The words return only when he thinks himself unheard.

Behind the counter, Harlan sleeps, roused only when someone calls his name. The proprietor is a big man gone soft, his belly straining against his shirt. His face is flushed, his breathing heavy. A bottle sits open beside him, its contents half-gone. Beneath the counter, his hand rests on a ledger, neat columns of numbers tracked in careful script.

"Late," Amos mutters, not looking up. His voice is slurred, his words directed at the floor.

"Always," Lila echoes, voice flat. She continues humming, the melody broken and strange.

Harlan grunts, half-awake. "Always comes." His eyes focus briefly on the man at the end of the bar, then drift away.

The words drift through the room, worn smooth by repetition. No one expects an answer. He moves to the bar, finds an empty stool at the far end. The wood is worn smooth, stained with rings from countless glasses. He sits carefully, back to the wall, watching the room.

A man slumps at a table near the door, head in his hands. His shoulders shake with each breath. A bottle sits empty before him, its label peeled away. His clothes are clean but wrinkled, his shoes polished but worn. He looks up once, eyes red, then returns to staring at the table. The miller. 

Lila laughs, sharp and sudden, breaking the hush. The sound cuts through the room. Amos grumbles, knocks over his mug, curses the world. Beer spreads across the bar, dripping onto the floor. Harlan stirs, looks at the mess, then settles back into sleep.

Eli laughs at something Harlan mutters, the sound sharp and reckless. She tosses back her drink, sets the glass down hard. The second glass sits untouched beside her elbow. She spins on her stool, surveying the room with bright, restless eyes.

Harlan slides a glass across the bar, liquid dark and nameless. The glass is chipped, its surface cloudy with age. He drinks, the taste sharp, unfamiliar. The alcohol burns his throat, settles hot in his stomach. He does not ask what it is.

Another man enters, moves toward the table by the door. The miller looks up from his drink, flour still dusting his sleeves. "My chair," he says, voice rough with drink and the day's frustrations. The newcomer sits anyway. A shove, a chair scraping. The miller grabs at the man's shirt, thick hands used to controlling mill machinery now trying to control flesh. They stumble near the entrance.

Harlan wakes, sighs. "Outside," he says.

Lila sings a line of an old song. "Down in the valley, the valley so low."

The fight winds down, both men too tired to continue. The miller retreats to the bar, muttering about respect and people taking what isn't theirs. The other man finds a different corner, nursing a split lip.

Eli slides the untouched glass toward him, liquid sloshing. He shakes his head. She shrugs, pulls it back, drinks it herself in two quick swallows. "Waste nothing," she says, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. The words carry an edge.

Harlan, noticing the empty glasses, pushes another his way without comment. He drinks again, the burn settling in his chest. The room grows warmer, or perhaps the alcohol makes it seem so. Conversations resume, quiet and broken.

A woman enters. She looks around, finds no welcome, and leaves again. The door slams behind her, shaking the windows. Harlan mutters something about keeping the damp out, then returns to his bottle.

He watches it all, saying nothing. The room is full of people who have nowhere else to go, nothing else to do. They drink because it helps, or because it doesn't matter.

Time passes. The glasses multiply, empty and forgotten. Lila's humming grows louder, more discordant. Amos continues his muttered conversation with the floor. The man by the door returns to his weeping. Others come and go, faces blurred by alcohol and shadow.

Eli stands abruptly, fishing more coins from her pocket. She counts them in her palm, then laughs at what she sees. "Easy come," she says to no one. She heads for the door, but stops, turns back. "River's not frozen yet." Her eyes are bright with something—alcohol, mischief, or both. She disappears into the dim evening air.

He leaves before dark, the sound of laughter and argument fading behind him. The night air hits him, clearing his head, sharpening his vision. He stumbles once on the uneven path, steadies himself on a fence post, the night air heavy with distant wood smoke. Above, clouds gather thick and heavy. The river flows unchanged, its current moving steady and sure toward the sea.

Behind him, the bar continues its nightly ritual. The lights burn dim, the voices carry on, and the bottles empty one by one.
