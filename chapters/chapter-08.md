# Chapter 8: The Ledger’s Weight

Evening settles, the store nearly bare. Shelves stripped, only dust and a few sacks left. Lamps burn low. Ada sweeps the floor, ledger closed on the counter, hands slow, eyes dull with fatigue.

He enters, hat in hand, eyes on the shelves—less there than before. Ada nods, fills his order in silence. No words. The ledger stays closed.

A child appears at the door, thin and silent. Ada slips a loaf of bread into a bag, hands it over without a word. The child’s eyes widen, gratitude and shame mingling. Eli stands outside, arms crossed, pride holding her back from stepping inside.

He leaves a coin on the counter, more than he owes. Ada lets it sit, then sweeps it into the drawer. The store closes, the street empty.

He walks home, bread under his arm, the river dark beside him. At the edge of the yard, he sets the bag down on the old crate by the fence. Eli’s shadow lingers nearby, then slips away into the night.
