# Chapter 8: The Ledger’s Weight

Evening settles, the store quiet, lamps burning low. Ada sweeps the floor, ledger open on the counter. The protagonist enters, hat in hand, eyes on the shelves. He asks for flour, salt, a little coffee. Ada nods, fills the order, adds a line to the ledger.

A child appears at the door, thin and silent. Ada slips a loaf of bread into a bag, hands it over without a word. The child’s eyes widen, gratitude and shame mingling. Eli stands outside, watching, arms crossed, pride holding her back from stepping inside.

Ada glances at the ledger, at Eli’s name, at the protagonist. She says nothing. He leaves a coin on the counter, more than he owes. Ada lets it sit, then sweeps it into the drawer. The store closes, the street empty.

He walks home, bread under his arm, the river dark beside him. Eli’s shadow follows for a while, then disappears into the night.
