# Chapter 1: Monument

Gray light seeps through the cracks in the roof. Damp, cool air carries the faint smell of mud and old smoke—the shack breathing with the river. He sits up on the narrow bed, feet finding the splintered floor. Beyond the walls, the world holds its quiet, broken only by a distant train's call and the slow churn of water against the bank.

A train whistle, distant and mournful.

Joints stiff from the thin mattress, he moves to the window. The glass is filmed with dust and the memory of rain. Outside, gray dissolves slowly into shapes—the dock, the path, chickens scratching in their endless search. Among them, the rooster struts with chest puffed, though there is little to defend and less to rule.

A tin basin. Cold water. He washes his face, the sting waking him. The water is brown from the well, tasting of iron and earth. He cups it in his hands, drinks, feels it settle in his empty stomach. The mirror above the basin shows a face he recognizes but does not study—stubble, sun-weathered skin, gray eyes.

The stove is cold. He leaves it that way. The chill will pass.

Bread, hard as wood, chewed in silence. He tears it with his teeth, softens it with well water. Three days old, this loaf—bought when Mrs. Ada Bell had marked it down. By evening it will be harder still, but it will last.

Through the window, he watches the chickens scratch in the yard. Their movements are slow, resigned. They find little—a beetle, a seed, scraps of nothing—but they continue. The red hen favors her left leg. Still she scratches. Still she searches.

He takes the coffee tin from the shelf, counts the coins inside. Enough for today. The metal is warm, and the coins make a thin sound when he shakes them. He returns the tin to its place, next to the mason jar of fishhooks and the coil of line that needs mending.

Outside, the air is thick with mist. The grass is wet, the path to the river worn by his own feet. The stones are placed where he placed them, the earth shaped by his passing.

Mist hangs low, blurring the line between water and land. The river runs thick with mud, carrying what it always carries—branches, leaves, the occasional fish swimming belly-up. Upstream, the rain has been heavy. The water is higher today, lapping at the dock's edge with a sound like whispers.

Across the river, the factory stands empty, windows broken, a hollow shell. Once, men walked those girders, hammered steel, built things that lasted. Now only the frame remains, rusted. The machines were sold, the workers scattered. The building stands as a monument to what was.

Someone moves among the girders—quick, restless, climbing the rusted frame, disappearing, reappearing, a flash of movement in the gray. A figure in the dawn light, moving, always across the river.

The figure is too far to see clearly, but the movement is urgent, purposeful, searching for something in the bones of the old factory. Sometimes the figure stops, becomes still, and seems to look across the water. Sometimes it waves, though whether at him or at someone else, he cannot say.

He does not wave back. 

The walk to the dock takes him past the chicken coop, where the birds gather near the fence. The red hen limps forward, hopeful. He reaches into his pocket, finds the crumbs saved from his bread. Hard crumbs, barely worth saving, but the chickens receive them eagerly. The red hen gets most of them.

He checks the nesting boxes. Three eggs, still warm. He lifts them carefully, turns them in his palm. Good shells, no cracks. He slips them into his jacket pocket, cushioned by the worn fabric. Mrs. Ada Bell will give him credit for them, or maybe the proprietor at the bar needs them for the evening meal.

The boards creak under his weight. The river is brown, sluggish, carrying branches and silt from upstream. He kneels, checks the line he left overnight. The hook is bare. The bait is gone—stolen by a turtle, perhaps, or dissolved in the current. He pulls up the line, examines the hook, finds it clean and bright.

From his pocket, he takes the coffee tin with the earthworms. Three worms, fat and dark. He threads one onto the hook, careful not to kill it too quickly. The worm twists, seeking earth that is not there. He casts the line, watches it disappear into the brown water, counts the ripples as they fade.

The river takes what it wants. Sometimes it gives back.

A boat appears through the mist, Reed at the oars. The old man rows with steady strokes, his boat low in the water with the weight of his nets. Their eyes meet across the water. Reed nods, raises one hand briefly from the oar. He nods back. No words pass between them.

Reed's boat carries the smell of fish and tar, the sound of water against wood. The old man's face is weathered, his hands cracked from years of rope and net. His boat is older than most, patched and re-patched, but it floats. It holds. It endures. A flask catches the light from beneath the seat, its metal worn smooth by handling.

The boat drifts past, and Reed disappears into the mist. The river carries them both, each in their own direction, each in their own silence.

He remains on the dock, listening to the water, watching the mist thin and rise. Soon the sun will break through, and the day will begin in earnest. The town will wake, children will run to the river, women will hang laundry, men will gather on porches.

He stands, brushes dirt from his knees, and checks the line once more. Still nothing. The hook dangles in the current. He does not reel it in. The river will decide.

Behind him, the chickens have finished their crumbs and returned to their scratching. The red hen still favors her left leg, but she moves with the others. The rooster watches from his perch on the fence post, chest puffed, though the sun has not yet crowned him king of anything.

The mist begins to lift, revealing the far shore, the broken factory, the empty places where people once worked and lived and hoped. The figure is gone now, dissolved into shadow and morning.

He turns from the river, walks the worn path back to the shack. The day stretches ahead, long and familiar. There will be work to do—nets to mend, wood to gather, small repairs that keep the world from falling apart. There will be the store to visit, if the coins stretch far enough. There will be the evening, and the line to check again, and the same brown water carrying the same mysterious cargo downstream.

The train whistle sounds again, distant and mournful. He listens until it fades, then steps inside the shack and closes the door. The latch clicks. The day begins.

Through the window, the river runs on, steady and eternal.
