# Chapter 1: Monument

Gray light seeps through the cracks in the roof. Damp, cool air carries the faint smell of mud and old smoke—the shack breathing with the river. He sits up on the narrow bed, feet finding the splintered floor. Beyond the walls, the world holds its quiet, broken only by a distant train's call and the slow churn of water against the bank.

Joints stiff from the thin mattress, he moves to the window. The glass is filmed with dust and the memory of rain. Outside, gray dissolves slowly into shapes—the dock, the path, chickens scratching in their endless search. Among them, the red hen limps forward, persistent despite her bad leg. The rooster keeps watch from his fence post perch, chest puffed though there is little to defend and less to rule.

A tin basin. Cold water. He washes his face, the sting waking him. The water is brown from the well, tasting of iron and earth. He cups it in his hands, drinks, feels it settle in his empty stomach. The mirror above the basin shows a face he recognizes but does not study—stubble, sun-weathered skin, gray eyes.

The stove is cold. He leaves it that way. The chill will pass.

Bread, hard as wood, chewed in silence. He tears it with his teeth, softens it with well water. Bought three days ago, when Mrs. Ada Bell marked it down. By evening it will be harder still, but it will last.

He takes the coffee tin from the shelf, counts the coins inside. Enough for today. The metal is warm, and the coins make a thin sound when he shakes them. He returns the tin to its place, next to the mason jar of fishhooks and the coil of line that needs mending.

Outside, mist thickens the air. The path to the river lies worn smooth, each stone settled in its place.

The river runs thick with mud, carrying branches and silt from upstream. The factory rises on the far bank—a monument of broken windows and rusted girders reaching into the gray sky. Scattered machines rust in the weeds below.

He recognizes Eli's shape among the girders—quick, restless, climbing the rusted frame with familiar grace. She disappears, reappears, a flash of movement in the gray. Her jacket catches the dawn light as she moves, always across the river.

The distance blurs her features, but her movements are urgent, purposeful. Sometimes she stops, becomes still, seems to look across the water. Sometimes she waves, though whether at him or at someone else, he cannot say.

He does not wave back.

The chickens gather at the coop as he passes. He scatters saved bread crumbs—hard, barely worth keeping, but the red hen limps forward eagerly, claiming most. In the nesting boxes, three eggs lie warm. He lifts them carefully, turns them in his palm. Good shells, no cracks. He slips them into his jacket pocket, cushioned by the worn fabric. Mrs. Ada Bell will give him credit for them, or Harlan at the bar will trade them for a meal.

The dock creaks under his weight as he kneels at its edge. He checks the line left overnight—hook bare, bait gone, stolen by a turtle perhaps, or dissolved in the current. 

From his pocket, he takes the coffee tin with the earthworms. Three worms, fat and dark. He threads one onto the hook, careful not to kill it too quickly. The worm twists, seeking earth that is not there. He casts the line, watches it disappear into the brown water, counts the ripples as they fade.

The river takes what it wants. Sometimes it gives back.

A boat appears through the mist, Reed at the oars. The old man rows with steady strokes, his boat low in the water with the weight of his nets. Their eyes meet across the water. Reed nods, raises one hand briefly from the oar. He nods back. No words pass between them.

Reed's boat carries the smell of fish and tar, the sound of water against wood. The old man's face is weathered, his hands cracked from years of rope and net. His boat is older than most, patched and re-patched, but it holds. A flask catches the light from beneath the seat, its metal worn smooth by handling.

The boat drifts past, dissolving into the morning haze. The river carries them both, each in their own direction, each in their own silence.

He remains on the dock, listening to the water. Soon the day will begin in earnest. The town will wake, children will run to the river, women will hang laundry, men will gather on porches.

He stands, brushes dirt from his knees, and checks the line once more. Still nothing. The hook dangles in the current.

The far shore stands empty now. Where Eli moved among the girders, only shadow remains.

Behind him, the chickens have returned to their scratching. The rooster watches from the fence post.

He turns from the river, walks the worn path back to the shack. The day stretches ahead. The eggs need trading, work might be found at the mill. The store might have what he needs, if the coins are enough.

The train whistle sounds again, distant and fading. He listens until it's gone, then steps inside. The latch clicks.

Through the window, the river moves past.
