# Chapter 1: First Light

Gray light seeps through the cracks in the roof. The shack breathes with the river—damp, cool, a faint smell of mud and old smoke. The bed is narrow, the blanket thin. He sits up, feet on the splintered floor. The world is quiet except for the distant call of a train, the slow churn of water against the bank.

A tin basin. Cold water. He washes his face, the sting waking him. The stove is cold. He leaves it that way. Bread, hard as wood, chewed in silence. Chickens scratch in the yard, their movements slow, resigned. He watches them through the window, the glass clouded with dust and the memory of rain.

He steps outside. The grass is wet, the path to the river worn by his own feet. Mist hangs low, blurring the line between water and land. Across the river, the factory stands empty, windows broken, a hollow shell.

Someone moves among the girders—quick, restless, climbing the rusted frame, disappearing, reappearing, a flash of movement in the gray. Across the river, always before him, always moving: Eli.

He walks to the dock. Boards creak under his weight. The river is brown, sluggish, carrying branches and silt from upstream. He kneels, checks the line he left overnight. Nothing. The hook is bare. He drops it back in, watches the ripples fade.

A boat drifts past, Reed at the oars. No words. Just a nod, a glance. The river carries them both, each in their own direction. He stands, listens to the quiet, and waits for the sun to break through the mist.
