# Chapter 7: Design

The evening breeze strengthens, stirring leaves and carrying the first scent of rain. Storm clouds mass in the twilight, their weight pressing down on the town. He is caught in the open when the first drops fall.

Rain drums on tin roofs, turning dust to mud, paths to streams. Lightning splits distance, thunder rolling across water. The storm releases its burden in sheets, blurring the world to gray shapes.

He runs for the shed behind the mill, his boots slipping on the wet earth. The structure is old, its walls weathered, its roof patched with sheets of tin that sing under the rain's assault. The door hangs crooked on its hinges, creaking in the wind.

Inside, darkness thick, air heavy with the smell of wet earth and oil. The shed is cramped, filled with machinery—rusted gears, broken tools, lengths of chain that catch what little light filters through the gaps in the walls. Water drips through the roof in places, pooling on the dirt floor.

Mara is already there, sitting on a wooden crate, arms folded. She nods when he enters, makes room without speaking. Her hair is damp, her dress clinging to her frame. Through gaps in the walls, the mill house stands dark. A small canvas bag sits beside her, drawstring pulled close, positioned away from the drips.

Outside, the rain continues its assault. The mill wheel creaks and groans, turned by the swollen stream. Lightning flashes, the world white for a moment, revealing the shed's contents in stark detail—the rust, the decay, the remnants of work once done.

They sit in silence, listening to the storm. The air is close, humid, filled with the scent of rain and earth and something else—the metallic smell of old machinery, the mustiness of a place long unused.

Thunder rolls overhead, shaking the tin roof. She shifts on the crate, stands, moves closer. Her breath is warm against his neck. The rain continues, masking sound, masking movement. Lightning flashes again, throwing their shadows against the walls. Her hands move to his shirt. 

They move together in the darkness, finding rhythm with the storm.

After, she dresses without looking at him, her movements efficient, matter-of-fact. He buttons his shirt, stares at the floor. The rain slows to a steady patter, then to scattered drops. The storm is passing, leaving the world washed and clean.

She stands, smooths her dress, checks the door. The wind has died down, and the thunder has moved on. She picks up the canvas bag, hefts its weight, then sets it down again. She leaves first, slipping into the night without a backward glance, without a word of farewell. The door closes behind her with a soft click.

He waits, listens to the last drops on the roof, counts the seconds between lightning and thunder. The storm is moving away, taking its energy with it. The air is cooler now, cleaner, carrying the scent of rain-washed earth.

He steps out into the wet grass. The mill wheel still turns, the river still runs, unseen in the dark. Puddles reflect the sky, and the air tastes of rain and the promise of morning.

The path back to his shack is muddy, treacherous in the darkness. He walks carefully, feeling his way, his boots squelching in the wet earth. The storm has passed, leaving only its scent of clean air.

Behind him, the shed settles back into silence. The machinery rusts, the rain drips through the roof.

The river waits, brown and swollen with rain, carrying the storm's runoff toward the sea. The night is quiet except for the drip of water from the trees, the distant call of a night bird, the soft whisper of the current against the bank.

He reaches his shack, pushes open the door, steps inside. The familiar smell of old wood and river air greets him. He lies down on the narrow bed, listens to the rain's last drops on the roof, and waits for sleep to come.

Outside, the night continues. The storm has washed the air clean.
