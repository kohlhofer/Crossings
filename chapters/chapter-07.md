# Chapter 7: The Drifter's Word

Dawn breaks slow and gray, the street empty, the church steps slick with dew. The air is cool, carrying the scent of wet earth and river mist. He walks the path toward the square, bread in hand—yesterday's loaf, hard but edible.

A man sits on the church steps, coat damp, boots muddy, hands wrapped around his knees. He is older, his hair gray and unkempt, his face weathered by sun and wind. A canvas bag sits beside him, its contents unknown. He rocks slightly as he sits, his eyes fixed on the empty street.

He slows, nods. The man nods back, offers a seat with a gesture of his hand. No words at first, just the quiet of the morning and the sound of birds stirring in the trees. The stone steps are cold and wet, but he sits, keeping distance between them.

The stranger speaks, his voice soft, almost lost in the morning air. Something about the river, about letting go. The words are simple, unadorned, but they carry weight. He speaks of water that remembers, of things that must be released to find peace. His accent is unfamiliar, his cadence measured.

"River knows," the man says. "Knows what we can't bear to know ourselves."

The words linger in the air, settling like mist. He listens without responding, watching the stranger's face, noting the lines around his eyes, the way his hands shake slightly in the morning cold.

A shadow moves at the edge of the square—perhaps someone familiar, perhaps not. The figure lingers by the miller's fence, barely visible in the morning light. A shift in the shadows, a suggestion of movement, then stillness. The morning light plays tricks with the eye.

The church door opens with a creak. Ada steps out, a cup in her hand, steam rising from the hot liquid. She pauses when she sees the stranger, her expression unreadable. She moves down the steps, her footsteps careful on the wet stone.

She sets the cup beside the stranger, says nothing for a moment. The steam rises between them, carrying the scent of coffee and warmth. Then, quietly, "Here you are, Josiah." Her voice is gentle, familiar.

The man—Josiah—looks up, his eyes meeting hers. He wraps his hands around the cup, lets the warmth seep into his fingers.

"Thank you, Ada," he says. His voice is stronger now, more present. "You're kind to an old fool."

She shakes her head, dismissing the comment. "Coffee's not much," she says. "But it's hot."

Brother Calvin watches from the church window, his face visible through the glass. His frown deepens as he observes the scene. His hand rests on the window frame, his knuckles white with pressure. He does not come outside, but his disapproval is clear.

Ada ignores the watching eyes, settling herself on the step beside Josiah. She does not speak, but her presence is a comfort. The morning grows lighter, and the town begins to stir. A rooster crows in the distance, and smoke rises from a chimney across the square.

"You been walking long?" Ada asks.

Josiah sips his coffee, considering the question. "Long enough," he says. "Roads all look the same after a while."

He watches the exchange, noting the ease between them, the way Ada's kindness flows naturally, without expectation.

A child runs past, chasing a dog. The dog barks, tail wagging, and the child laughs. The sound carries across the square, bright and clear. Josiah smiles, the first genuine expression he has seen from him.

"Town's waking up," Ada observes.

"Always does," Josiah replies. "World keeps turning, whether we're ready or not."

Brother Calvin's figure disappears from the window, but his presence lingers. He can feel the preacher's judgment from inside the church, his disapproval of the stranger, of Ada's kindness, of anything that disrupts the order he tries to maintain.

The shadow at the edge of the square flickers again, like something half-remembered. A movement in the periphery, there and gone. Josiah's eyes drift toward the spot, and he speaks softly to the morning air. "River's not the only thing that remembers." His words carry on the wind, directed at nothing and everything.

He watches this careful space, the way Ada and Josiah exist in their quiet moment.

The town moves on, the day unfolding. People emerge from their houses, beginning their morning routines. The baker opens his shop, the miller starts his wheel, and the sound of daily life fills the air. But the small group on the church steps remains apart, existing in their own quiet space.

Josiah finishes his coffee, sets the cup down beside him. He stands, shouldering his canvas bag, preparing to leave. Ada rises too, taking the empty cup without comment.

"Where will you go?" she asks.

"Down the river," he says. "Always down the river."

He looks at the man beside him, their eyes meeting for a moment. "River's calling," he says. "Best to listen when it does."

He nods. Josiah looks toward where Eli sits, silent as shadow. He speaks to the morning, his words carrying on the air. "River's not the only thing that remembers."

With that, he walks away, his boots squelching in the mud. He disappears down the road that leads to the river, his figure growing smaller until it is lost in the morning haze.

Ada watches him go. She turns to him, but then thinks better of it. Instead, she nods and returns to the church, the empty cup in her hand.

He stands, brushes the dampness from his clothes, and continues his walk through the town. Behind him, the church steps are empty again, marked only by the wet imprint of where two people shared a moment of quiet understanding.

The river flows beyond the trees, carrying debris downstream. The day has begun, and the town wakes. The stranger's words linger in the morning air.
