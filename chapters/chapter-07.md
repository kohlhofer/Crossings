# Chapter 7: The Drifter's Word

Dawn, the street empty, the church steps slick with dew. He walks the path, bread in hand. A man sits on the steps, coat damp, boots muddy, hands wrapped around his knees. 

He slows, nods. The man nods back, offers a seat, a word—soft, almost lost in the morning air. Something about the river, about letting go. The words linger, simple, unadorned.

A shadow moves at the edge of the square—Eli, or someone like her. She lingers, listening.


The church door opens. Ada steps out, a cup in her hand, steam rising. She sets it beside him, says nothing for a moment. Then, quietly, "Here you are, Josiah." Brother Calvin watches from the window, frown deepening.

The town moves on, the day unfolding. Josiah finishes his drink, stands, and disappears down the road.
