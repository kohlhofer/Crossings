# Chapter 7: The Drifter's Word

Josiah arrives with the dawn, coat damp, boots muddy. He sits on the church steps, hands wrapped around a tin cup, steam rising. The town stirs, people passing with wary glances. He greets each with a nod, a quiet word, never asking for more.

The protagonist passes by, bread in hand. Josiah offers a seat, a piece of adviceâ€”soft, almost lost in the morning air. Something about the river, about letting go. The words linger, simple, unadorned. Eli stands nearby, listening but pretending not to. She scuffs her boot, restless, then slips away.

Brother Calvin watches from the window, frown deepening. Ada brings Josiah a cup of coffee, sets it beside him, says nothing. The town moves on, the day unfolding. Josiah finishes his drink, stands, and disappears down the road, leaving only the echo of his words behind.
