# Chapter 7: Shelter

Rain falls hard, drumming on the tin roofs. The sky opens without warning, releasing water in sheets that blur the world into gray shapes. He is caught between the mill and the river, no shelter but the trees that offer little protection from the downpour.

The storm comes sudden, after the day's heat. The air had been thick and still, pressing down like a weight. Now it breaks, releasing its burden in torrents that turn the dust to mud, the paths to streams. Lightning flashes in the distance, followed by thunder that rolls across the water.

He runs for the shed behind the mill, his boots slipping on the wet earth. The structure is old, its walls weathered, its roof patched with sheets of tin that sing under the rain's assault. The door hangs crooked on its hinges, creaking in the wind.

Inside, darkness thick, air heavy with the smell of wet earth and oil. The shed is cramped, filled with machinery—rusted gears, broken tools, lengths of chain that catch what little light filters through the gaps in the walls. Water drips through the roof in places, pooling on the dirt floor.

Mara is already there, sitting on a wooden crate, arms folded, eyes on the door. She nods when he enters, makes room without speaking. Her hair is damp, her dress clinging to her frame. She glances briefly toward the mill house through the gaps in the walls, then settles back. A small canvas bag sits beside her, carefully positioned away from the dripping water.

Outside, the rain continues its assault. The mill wheel creaks and groans, turned by the swollen stream. Lightning flashes, the world white for a moment, revealing the shed's contents in stark detail—the rust, the decay, the remnants of work once done.

They sit in silence, listening to the storm. The air is close, humid, filled with the scent of rain and earth and something else—the metallic smell of old machinery, the mustiness of a place long unused. A rat scurries across the floor, disappearing into the shadows.

Thunder rolls overhead, shaking the tin roof. She shifts on the crate, her movements careful, economical. He leans against the wall, feeling the rough wood against his back. The storm shows no signs of stopping.

She stands, moves closer, her movements practical, unhurried. No words, no tender touches. He does not resist, does not question. The act is wordless, mechanical, a brief joining of bodies for warmth, for need, for nothing more. She has timed this as carefully as her appearances in doorways, her strategic movements through the mill house. 

The rain continues, masking any sound they might make. Lightning flashes again, throwing their shadows against the walls. The storm is the only witness.

After, she dresses without looking at him, her movements efficient, matter-of-fact. He buttons his shirt, stares at the floor. The rain slows to a steady patter, then to scattered drops. The storm is passing, leaving the world washed and clean.

She stands, smooths her dress, checks the door. The wind has died down, and the thunder has moved on. She leaves first, slipping into the night without a backward glance, without a word of farewell. The door closes behind her with a soft click.

He waits, listens to the last drops on the roof, counts the seconds between lightning and thunder. The storm is moving away, taking its energy with it. The air is cooler now, cleaner, carrying the scent of rain-washed earth.

He steps out into the wet grass. The world is unchanged. The mill wheel still turns, the river still runs, unseen in the dark. Puddles reflect the sky, and the air tastes of rain and the promise of morning.

The path back to his shack is muddy, treacherous in the darkness. He walks carefully, feeling his way, his boots squelching in the wet earth. The storm has passed, leaving only the memory of its violence and the smell of clean air.

Behind him, the shed settles back into silence. The machinery rusts, the rain drips through the roof, and the world continues its slow turn toward dawn.

The river waits, brown and swollen with rain, carrying the storm's runoff toward the sea. The night is quiet except for the drip of water from the trees, the distant call of a night bird, the soft whisper of the current against the bank.

He reaches his shack, pushes open the door, steps inside. The familiar smell of old wood and river air greets him. The storm has passed, and the world has returned to its usual rhythm. He lies down on the narrow bed, listens to the rain's last drops on the roof, and waits for sleep to come.

Outside, the night continues. The mill wheel turns, the river flows, and the world endures. The storm has washed the air clean, leaving the morning fresh and cool. The river still runs toward the sea, and the night still holds its secrets.
