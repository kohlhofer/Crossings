# Chapter 9: Gathering Darkness

Evening settles over the town, the store nearly bare. The last light of autumn fades through the windows, painting everything amber and gold. Shelves stripped, only dust and a few sacks left. The glass jars are empty, their lids removed. Lamps burn low, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. Outside, the temperature drops with the sun, and the first hint of winter rides the evening breeze.

Ada sweeps methodically, her movements slower than usual. The ledger lies closed on the counter, its pages thick with entries. Her hands are slow, eyes dull with fatigue. Lines have appeared around her mouth, and her shoulders sag. She pauses, glances toward the mill through the window. Mara hasn't been in for days.

The bell above the door chimes softly as he enters, hat in hand, eyes on the shelves—less there than before. Gaps where goods should be. The flour sacks are fewer, the shelves of patent medicines nearly empty. The store echoes with emptiness.

Ada looks up from her sweeping, nods without smiling. She moves to the counter, waiting. Her dress is clean but faded, her apron stained with the day's work. The lamp light catches the silver in her hair, making her look older than her years.

He points to the coffee tin on the shelf, then to the salt. She nods, understanding.

She moves to the shelves, gathering what little remains. The coffee tin is light in her hands, the salt bag half-empty. She weighs them carefully, her movements precise despite her weariness. The scale tips, settles, and she makes a note in her small notebook—not the ledger, but the one for credit.

No words pass between them. The silence is comfortable, familiar. Ada wraps his purchases in brown paper, her fingers working with practiced efficiency. The store creaks around them, settling into the evening quiet.

A child appears at the door, thin and silent. She is perhaps eight years old, her dress too large, her shoes held together with string. Her eyes are wide with hunger, her face pale with want. She does not speak, but her presence fills the doorway.

Ada glances at the child, then at her dwindling supplies. Without hesitation, she slips a loaf of bread into a bag, adds a small piece of cheese, and hands it over without a word. The child's eyes widen. Ada's hands shake slightly.

The child clutches the bag. She looks up at Ada, mouth opening as if to speak, then closes it again. A nod, a step backward.

Ada gestures gently toward the door, her expression soft but firm. The child understands.

She disappears into the evening shadows. Ada returns to her sweeping, her movements more deliberate now.

Through the window, Eli stands outside, arms crossed, pride holding her back from stepping inside. She watches the exchange, her face unreadable. He sees her there.

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out more coins than his purchase requires. The miller's two bits, once cold in his palm, now warm from his body, worn smooth by countless hands. He leaves them on the counter and pushes them toward Ada.

Ada looks at the coins, then at him. She lets them sit for a moment, then, with a small nod, she sweeps them into the drawer. The sound of metal against wood echoes in the empty store.

He takes his package, and moves toward the door. The bell chimes again as he steps outside, the sound fading into the evening air. Behind him, Ada continues her sweeping, preparing to close the store for another day.

The street is empty, lit only by the warm glow spilling from windows. A dog wanders past, sniffing at the ground, searching for scraps. The air is cool, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant river.

He walks home, bread under his arm, the river dark beside him. The water moves silently, its surface reflecting the last light of day. Crickets begin their evening chorus, and somewhere in the distance, a train whistle calls across the water.

At the edge of his yard, he pauses. The old crate by the fence sits empty, weathered by rain and sun. He sets his bag down on the crate, careful to keep the bread dry. Inside the bag, he leaves most of his purchases—the coffee, the salt.

Eli's shadow lingers nearby, a darker shape against the evening sky. She watches from the trees, her body tense, ready to flee if discovered. When he turns toward the shack, she steps forward, then stops.

He turns away, walks to his shack, and closes the door behind him. The latch clicks softly, and the evening settles into its familiar rhythm. Through the window, he can see the crate by the fence, the bag waiting in the gathering darkness.

The river flows past, dark and silent. The town sleeps. The night is kind to those who know how to move in shadows, how to take what is offered without being seen.

He lies on his narrow bed, listening to the sound of water against the bank. Outside, the night settles deeper, and the crate waits by the fence. Somewhere across the water, a lantern flickers—Reed's boat moving in the darkness.
