# Chapter 9: The Night Crossing

Night falls heavy, the river black and wide. He stands on the dock, lantern in hand, breath clouding in the cool air. Reed’s boat glides out of the darkness, silent, oars dipping slow. A nod, an invitation. He steps in, the boat rocking beneath him.

They cross in silence, water lapping against the hull. The far bank looms, trees tangled, shadows deep. Eli waits there, arms wrapped around her knees, eyes bright in the lantern’s glow. She says nothing, just climbs in, sits at the bow, restless, watching the water slip by.

Reed rows, face unreadable. The river carries them, no destination, just movement. The world narrows to the sound of oars, the creak of wood, the hush of night. Eli hums a tune, low and tuneless, lost in the dark.

They land on a spit of sand, nothing there but driftwood and the smell of mud. Eli jumps out, vanishes into the dark, footsteps fading along the water’s edge. Reed nods, pushes off, the boat rocking as it slips back into the current. The protagonist stays in the boat, listening to the river, the night thick around him, the world unchanged.
