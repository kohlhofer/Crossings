# Chapter 2: Out of Reach

The store sits low, clapboard faded, windows crowded with hand-lettered signs. Paint peels from the sills. The porch sags beneath seed sacks and weathered crates. Dust hangs in the air, stirred by a breeze that carries the scent of dry earth.

Molasses-sweet air wraps around him as the bell announces his entrance. Half-empty shelves hold stories in their gaps—flour sacks gone soft with age, penny candy catching light in high glass jars. Small rainbows dance across the worn counter, each nick and ring a memory of past transactions.

A child's breath clouds candy-jar glass, small fingers pressed against the barrier. Seven, maybe, in a clean but faded dress, shoes bearing playground scars. Near her, the mother's shoulders speak of weight, her twisted handkerchief a prayer.

Behind the counter, Ada's pencil whispers across her ledger. Each mark precise, each number a story. The counter bears its own ledger—rings from mason jars, cuts from countless trades. Patent medicines stand sentinel on shelves behind her, alongside tobacco tins and castor oil bottles.

Warmth pulses in his jacket pocket. He draws out each egg with reverence, shells uncracked, still holding morning's heat. Ada lifts them to the light, each nod a small blessing.

A different notebook opens, smaller than the ledger. Credit flows from her careful hand—three eggs transformed to numbers. Coffee and salt answer his pointing finger. The scale speaks its metallic truth, settling into certainty. Ground coffee fine as river silt, salt pure as morning frost.

She adds a line to the ledger, writing neat and steady. The page fills with names and numbers. The ledger lies thick on the counter, pages yellowed, binding cracked.

The child hasn't moved from the candy jars. Her breath clouds the glass. She wipes it with her sleeve. The mother steps closer, hand on the child's shoulder. The child points to peppermint sticks, red and white stripes. The mother shakes her head. The child's hand drops.

The mother looks at the candy, then at Ada. Ada's eyes stay on the ledger. After a moment, the mother takes the child's hand. They move to the door. The bell chimes their exit, footsteps fading on wood.

Ada marks the ledger again, eyes down.

A shadow passes the window—Brother Calvin wlaking his route. Her pencil stills. The store holds its breath.Then her hand returns to its work, each number drawn with careful precision.

He takes his parcel, nods, steps outside. The sun rides higher now. A stray dog pants in shade, ribs showing. He reaches into his pocket for a piece of his morning bread, drops it near. The dog sniffs, eats, tail moving once.

He stands a moment, coffee and salt heavy in the sack. Metal rings somewhere, hammer striking, then quiet. Through dusty glass, Ada sweeps the counter, each stroke measured.

Morning light catches dark hair like a blessing. Mara stands road-side, arms crossed against the world, still as weathered stone. Her eyes hold the sky's secrets as he passes.

Coffee and salt settle against his hip, a rhythm for walking. One will last a week, the other longer. Morning stretches its arms wide—work to find, life to store away in careful measures.

Dust and molasses embrace the store he leaves behind. In deeper shadows, the dog dreams of kindness.
