# Chapter 2: The Store Ledger

The store sits low to the ground, clapboard faded, windows crowded with hand-lettered signs. The bell above the door is silent—he pushes it open, the hinges groaning. Inside, the air is thick with dust and the faint sweetness of molasses. Shelves half-empty. Flour in cloth sacks. Penny candy in glass jars, out of reach for most.

A child stands by the jars, eyes wide, fingers pressed to the glass. The mother hovers nearby, shoulders tense, gaze fixed on the floor.

Ada stands behind the counter, ledger open, pencil in hand. She nods, eyes sharp, hands busy. No words at first. He places a few coins on the counter. She counts them, then weighs the bread, the coffee, the salt. The scale tips, settles. She adds a line to the ledger, her writing neat, unhurried.

He watches her hand move, the page crowded with names and numbers. Eli’s name is there, a line of debt that grows and shrinks but never disappears. Ada glances at the page, then at him, but says nothing.

Ada slips a piece of candy into a paper bag, says nothing. The child’s mother looks away, grateful and ashamed. He watches, silent, the exchange as routine as the creak of the floorboards.

He takes his parcel, nods, and steps outside. The sun is higher now, the street empty except for a stray dog and the sound of the river, always moving, always the same.

He stands for a moment, bread and salt in hand, watching the world go on. Through the dusty window, Ada closes the ledger, sweeps the counter.

A woman stands in the shade by the mill road, arms folded, watching the sky. He passes her without a word. Mara, maybe, or someone like her. Faces blur in the heat.
