# Chapter 2: Out of Reach

The store sits low, clapboard faded, windows crowded with hand-lettered signs. Paint peels from the sills. The porch sags beneath seed sacks and weathered crates. Dust hangs in the air, stirred by a breeze that carries the scent of dry earth.

The bell above the door chimes as he pushes it open. Inside, the air is thick with dust and molasses-sweet. Shelves half-empty. Flour in cloth sacks, sides soft with age. Penny candy in glass jars, high on the shelf. The jars catch light, casting small rainbows on the worn counter.

A child stands by the jars, eyes wide, fingers pressed to the glass. She might be seven, dress clean but faded, shoes scuffed at the toes. The mother stands near, shoulders tight, eyes on the floor. Her hands twist a handkerchief.

Ada stands behind the counter, ledger open, pencil moving. She nods at his entrance, eyes sharp. The counter bears rings from mason jars, cuts from countless transactions. Behind her, shelves hold patent medicines, bottles of castor oil, tobacco tins.

He reaches into his jacket pocket, careful with the eggs. The shells are warm, uncracked. He places them on the counter, one by one, turning them for Ada's inspection. She lifts each egg to the light, nods.

Ada opens a small notebook, different from the ledger, makes a mark. Credit for three eggs. She adds numbers in her careful hand, then looks up. He points to the coffee, the salt. She nods, reaches for each item, weighs them. The scale tips, settles. The coffee ground fine, salt white as river sand.

She adds a line to the ledger, writing neat and steady. The page fills with names and numbers. The ledger lies thick on the counter, pages yellowed, binding cracked.

The child hasn't moved from the candy jars. Her breath clouds the glass. She wipes it with her sleeve. The mother steps closer, hand on the child's shoulder. The child points to peppermint sticks, red and white stripes. The mother shakes her head. The child's hand drops.

The mother looks at the candy, then at Ada. Ada's eyes stay on the ledger. After a moment, the mother takes the child's hand. They move to the door. The bell chimes their exit, footsteps fading on wood.

Ada marks the ledger again, eyes down.

A shadow passes the window—Brother Calvin wlaking his route. Her pencil stills. The store holds its breath.Then her hand returns to its work, each number drawn with careful precision.

He takes his parcel, nods, steps outside. The sun rides higher now. A stray dog pants in shade, ribs showing. He reaches into his pocket for a piece of his morning bread, drops it near. The dog sniffs, eats, tail moving once.

He stands a moment, coffee and salt heavy in the sack. Metal rings somewhere, hammer striking, then quiet. Through dusty glass, Ada sweeps the counter, each stroke measured.

A woman waits in road-side shade, arms crossed, watching the sky. Dark hair, plain dress, still as stone. She doesn't look as he passes. Mara, perhaps. Morning light catches in her hair.

He shifts the parcel, feels the weight of coffee and salt. Coffee might last a week. Salt will last longer. The morning stretches ahead—purchases to store away, work to find.

Behind him, the store settles into its familiar scents of dust and molasses. The dog finds deeper shade.
