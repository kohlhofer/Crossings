# Drifter Preacher: Josiah

## Backstory

Josiah drifts from town to town, never staying long, carrying little more than a battered satchel and a worn Bible. He has no church, no congregation, and no means—living off the kindness of strangers and what little he can earn or trade. The hardships of the road have left their mark: he drinks when he can, smokes when he has tobacco, and sometimes sleeps rough by the river. Despite this, he carries a quiet, genuine faith that is felt more than spoken.

## Traits

- Weathered, with gentle eyes and a soft, gravelly voice
- Clothes patched and faded, boots worn thin
- Quick to smile, slow to judge
- Bears the marks of hunger and hard travel
- Never calls himself a preacher, but others do

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Offers small, timely wisdom—never grand sermons, just a word or gesture that matters in the moment
- Helps without fanfare: mending a fence, sharing a meal, sitting with the grieving
- Accepts his vices without shame, but never lets them define him
- Prays quietly, often by the river or in the woods, never in public
- Listens more than he speaks, but when he does, his words linger
- Moves on before he can outstay his welcome, leaving behind a sense of calm or hope
- Cares for others in unobtrusive ways, noticing what is needed and providing it if he can
- Endures hardship with humility, accepting suffering as part of life. Never judges others for their burdens, but offers comfort when he can.

## Role in the Story

Josiah is a counterpoint to Brother Calvin—a genuinely spiritual presence, humble and flawed, whose wisdom and kindness make a difference in small, crucial moments. He is a reminder that faith can be quiet, practical, and deeply human. His actions and presence in the story should reflect the book's philosophy (see philosophy.md), especially humility, small kindnesses, and the ambiguity of faith.
