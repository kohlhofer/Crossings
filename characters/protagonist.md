# Protagonist

## Backstory

He lives alone in a shack on the outskirts, close to the water. In a town large enough for indifference, people like him pass unnoticed—one of many who live on the edge, marked by poverty and marginalization. The difference between poor and 'not poor' is small: a little land, a fishing boat, a machine. No one really thinks about people like him as individuals, and there is little curiosity or interest. The reasons for his solitude are unclear—perhaps a matter of choice, perhaps the result of old wounds or quiet misfortune. He carries himself with a kind of wary self-sufficiency, neither seeking nor shunning company.

## Traits

- Observant, attuned to the rhythms of the river and the land
- Quiet, speaks little but listens closely
- Resourceful, skilled at fishing, mending, and making do
- Haunted by memory, but rarely speaks of the past
- Kindness shown in small, practical ways rather than words
- Neither young nor old—his age is hard to place, weathered by sun and time

## Character Arc

He is drawn, sometimes unwillingly, into the lives and stories of others. Encounters with the uncanny undercurrents of the river and the beliefs of the townsfolk challenge his isolation. Over time, he must confront the reasons for his solitude and decide whether to remain apart or rejoin the world he left behind.
