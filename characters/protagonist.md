# Protagonist

## Backstory

He lives alone in a shack on the outskirts, close to the water. In a town large enough for indifference, people like him pass unnoticed—one of many who live on the edge, marked by poverty and marginalization. The difference between poor and 'not poor' is small: a little land, a fishing boat, a machine. No one really thinks about people like him as individuals, and there is little curiosity or interest. The reasons for his solitude are unclear—perhaps a matter of choice, perhaps the result of old wounds or quiet misfortune. He carries himself with a kind of wary self-sufficiency, neither seeking nor shunning company.

## Motivations

He is simply trying to carve out a living, day by day. He has no interest in changing his circumstances or striving for more. He is not driven by dreams or regrets, and is not overly reflective—though the reader may sense a complex inner world beneath his actions. He is observant, attuned to the world around him, but never judgmental; any conclusions or judgments are left to the reader. He lacks the terms for it, but he is, at heart, a stoic—accepting what comes, enduring what must be endured.

He is not religious or spiritual, even though the world around him often is. He deals in reality, shaped by a harsh and indifferent world. More often than not, he simply reacts to the cues around him, sometimes with a blatant disregard for common wisdom or expectation.

## Character Arc

Over time, he must confront the reasons for his solitude and decide whether to remain apart or rejoin the world he left behind.
