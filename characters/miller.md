# Miller

## Backstory

The miller has run the mill for over twenty years, watching the grain business decline as farms fail and people move away. He married Mara when she was young and he was building his reputation. The mill's prosperity has dwindled, and with it, his temper has grown shorter. He blames everyone—the weather, the farmers, his wife—for the mill's struggles, but never examines his own role in the decline.

## Role in the Story

The miller represents the theme of self-imposed suffering—his controlling behavior and constant criticism drive away both customers and happiness. He embodies the kind of unnecessary hardship that people create for themselves and others. His treatment of Mara shows how some people's need for control creates cycles of misery.

His presence in the story serves to highlight the book's philosophy about the quiet weight of choice—both his choices to be cruel and controlling, and Mara's choices to endure and find small moments of agency. He is neither villainous nor sympathetic, simply a man who has chosen bitterness over adaptation.
