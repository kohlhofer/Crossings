# Patron: Lila

## Backstory

Lila arrived in town years ago, her past a matter of rumor and speculation. She claims to have been a singer once, but now her voice is rough from drink and smoke. She keeps a battered suitcase under her chair, its contents a mystery. She rarely leaves the bar except to sleep in a nearby shed.

## Traits

- Sharp-eyed, with a laugh that cuts through the gloom
- Dresses in faded finery, always a little out of place
- Quick with a joke or a biting remark
- Sings old songs late at night, when the mood is right
- Fiercely protective of her few possessions

## Role in the Bar

Lila is a fixture, both companion and provocateur. She keeps the others talking, sometimes laughing, sometimes fighting, but always coming back.
