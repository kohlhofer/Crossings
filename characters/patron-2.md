# Patron: Lila

## Backstory

Lila arrived in town years ago, her past a matter of rumor and speculation. She claims to have been a singer once, but now her voice is rough from drink and smoke. She keeps a battered suitcase under her chair, its contents a mystery. She rarely leaves the bar except to sleep in a nearby shed.

## Traits

- Sharp-eyed, with a laugh that cuts through the gloom
- Dresses in faded finery, always a little out of place
- Quick with a joke or a biting remark
- Sings old songs late at night, when the mood is right
- Fiercely protective of her few possessions
- Clings to hardship and drama, sometimes creating it for herself
- Has a history of mechanical, arbitrary sexual encounters with the protagonist, which have since ceased for no particular reason. These encounters were unsentimental and left no lasting connection.

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Holds court at a corner table, drawing others in with stories, gossip, or song
- Flirts and teases, but can turn cold or cutting if crossed
- Defends her suitcase and chair with surprising ferocity
- Breaks tension with humor, but sometimes stirs it up for her own amusement
- Sings to herself when alone, voice soft and wistful
- Offers comfort to newcomers, but never lets anyone get too close
- Has a habit of producing small, odd items from her suitcase to trade or gift

## Role in the Bar

Lila is a fixture, both companion and provocateur. She keeps the others talking, sometimes laughing, sometimes fighting, but always coming back.

- Her actions and presence in the story should reflect the book's philosophy (see philosophy.md), especially the dignity of the overlooked, ambiguity, and the weight of choice.
