# Mara

## Backstory

Mara has lived in the town for years, but remains on its periphery—neither an outcast nor a fixture. She works odd jobs, keeps to herself, and is rarely the subject of gossip. Her presence is steady but unremarkable, and she is known for her practicality and reserve.

## Traits

- Practical, self-contained, and unsentimental
- Not seeking connection or intimacy
- Direct in her actions and words
- Neither warm nor cold—simply present
- Her motivations are left ambiguous

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Interacts with the protagonist in a moment of mutual need—perhaps sheltering from a storm, sharing a meal, or in a deserted place
- The sexual encounter is mechanical, wordless or nearly so, marked by necessity rather than desire
- No expectation of a relationship, no emotional aftermath—just a return to solitude
- Returns to her routine without comment or change

## Role in the Story

Mara serves to underscore the protagonist's passivity and the mechanical nature of human need. Their encounter is not arousing or meaningful, but simply a basic fulfillment of need. Her presence is a reminder of the absence of connection in the protagonist's life.
