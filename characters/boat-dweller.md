# Boat-Dweller: "Reed"

## Backstory

No one knows where Reed lives—only that he is always seen in his small, weathered boat, drifting along the river at odd hours. Some presume he is fishing or checking crab traps, but no one has ever seen him haul in a catch or tie up for long. He is a fixture on the water, as much a part of the river as the mist or the herons.

## Traits

- Lean, sun-darkened, with a hat pulled low and a faded coat
- Speaks little, voice rough from disuse
- Eyes always scanning the water, rarely meeting another's gaze
- Moves with the slow, practiced ease of someone who belongs on the river
- Keeps a battered oar and a coil of rope within reach

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Only ever encountered in his boat, gliding past docks or pausing midstream
- Interactions are brief, often just a nod or a few words in passing
- Occasionally gives people a ride, but never invites conversation
- Avoids crowds and gatherings, never seen on land or in town
- Sometimes leaves small gifts—fish, a bundle of reeds, a carved lure—on docks or porches
- Believes in the river remembers, but is guarded about it; will only speak of it in hints, wary of being thought crazy

## Role in the Story

Reed is an enigma, a silent presence on the river. He is both a rumor and a reality, a reminder that some lives are lived entirely on the margins. His belief in the river's memory connects him to the uncanny undercurrent of the story, even as he keeps his distance from others.

- Chooses hardship and isolation, living on the river by choice or necessity. Never asks for help, and quietly endures whatever comes.
- His actions and presence in the story should reflect the book's philosophy (see philosophy.md), especially endurance, ambiguity, and the dignity of isolation.
