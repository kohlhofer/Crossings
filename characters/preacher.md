# Preacher: Brother Calvin

## Backstory

Brother Calvin came to town years ago, claiming a calling and a mission. He took over the church when no one else would, patching it together with scraps and donations. He believes himself a good Christian, a shepherd to his flock, but his actions rarely match his words. He is more concerned with appearances than with grace, and his sermons are filled with warnings and judgment.

## Traits

- Always dressed in a threadbare suit, collar askew
- Voice loud in the pulpit, soft in private
- Quick to quote scripture, slow to offer real help
- Keeps a careful ledger of donations and debts
- Prides himself on propriety, but is careless with kindness

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Seen sweeping the church steps or arranging wilted flowers, always fussing over appearances
- Greets newcomers with a practiced smile, but rarely remembers their names
- Delivers fiery sermons, but avoids real confrontation or sacrifice
- Accepts gifts and favors, but rarely gives in return
- Avoids the bar, but gossips about its patrons
- When challenged, becomes defensive, insisting on his own righteousness
- Sometimes found alone in the church, muttering prayers or counting coins
- Prays on the community, extracting favors, donations, and secrets under the guise of spiritual guidance
- Maintains a relationship with the shopkeeper that he believes is secret, though it is common knowledge in town
- Publicly rallies against the outcasts and drifters, blaming them for the town's troubles
- Holds a specific enmity toward the protagonist, often using sermons or gossip to single him out as an example of what's wrong with the community

## Role in the Story

Brother Calvin is the town's preacher in name, a figure of ritual and habit. He is respected by some, tolerated by most, and truly known by few. His presence is a reminder of the gap between faith and practice, and the ways people cling to appearances in the face of hardship.

- Encourages unnecessary hardship in others through guilt, suspicion, and ritual. Blind to his own self-imposed suffering, he preaches endurance but never questions its purpose.
- His actions and presence in the story should reflect the book's philosophy (see philosophy.md), especially ambiguity, the weight of choice, and the endurance of self-imposed hardship.
