# Younger Self: "Eli"

## Backstory

Eli is not new to the town—she has always been on its margins, living in the derelict abandoned factory at the edge of the river. The factory is unsafe but provides shelter to a handful of hopeless sorts, including Eli. She is restless and impulsive, always looking for a way out or a shortcut to something better. She has not yet learned the value of endurance or the cost of pride. Eli's presence is strikingly asexual—her energy and recklessness are not tied to romance or desire, but to a restless need for movement and escape.

## Traits

- Female, but presents herself in a way that is almost asexual
- Reckless, quick to anger or laughter
- Impatient with routine, always seeking excitement or escape
- Lacks the stoic acceptance of the older protagonist
- Generous in spirit, but careless with her own well-being
- Drawn to risk, whether in work, drink, or relationships (but not romantic ones)

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Takes unnecessary risks on the river or in town, often getting into trouble
- Spends freely, drinks hard, and laughs loudly, but the joy is fleeting
- Rejects advice or help, convinced she can handle things on her own
- Clashes with older, more settled characters, especially the protagonist
- Is admired by some for her spirit, pitied by others for her naivety
- Her interactions are rarely, if ever, romantic or sexual—her focus is on survival, escape, and the next thrill
- Often like a shadow, semi-hidden, following the protagonist around town—sometimes just out of sight, sometimes lingering nearby, rarely directly interacting unless necessary

## Role in the Story

Eli serves as a living contrast to the protagonist's stoic endurance. Her recklessness and refusal to accept the world as it is make her unlikely to survive in the long run. Through Eli, the story explores the cost of pride, the dangers of impatience, and the hard-won wisdom of endurance. Her asexuality further sets her apart, making her energy and restlessness feel elemental rather than personal.
