# Patron: Amos

## Backstory

Amos has been a fixture at the bar for as long as anyone can remember. Once a fisherman, he lost his boat to debt and bad luck. Now he drifts from day to day, sleeping in a back room or on the porch when the weather is warm. He has no family left, or none that claim him.

## Traits

- Gaunt, with a face like driftwood
- Speaks in mutters and half-remembered stories
- Quick to anger, but the fire fades fast
- Trades odd jobs for drinks, never quite sober
- Knows the river's moods better than his own

## Role in the Bar

Amos is both a warning and a comfort to the othersâ€”a reminder of how far one can fall, and how long one can linger at the bottom.
