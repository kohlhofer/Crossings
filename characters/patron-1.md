# Patron: Amos

## Backstory

Amos has been a fixture at the bar for as long as anyone can remember. Once a fisherman, he lost his boat to debt and bad luck. Now he drifts from day to day, sleeping in a back room or on the porch when the weather is warm. He has no family left, or none that claim him.

## Traits

- Gaunt, with a face like driftwood
- Speaks in mutters and half-remembered stories
- Quick to anger, but the fire fades fast
- Trades odd jobs for drinks, never quite sober
- Knows the river's moods better than his own

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Sits hunched at the end of the bar, clutching a chipped mug, eyes darting to the door at every sound
- Reacts defensively to questions about his past or the river, sometimes with a sharp word or a sullen silence
- Offers advice no one asks for, often in the form of warnings or superstitions
- When provoked, may lash out verbally or even physically, but quickly retreats or apologizes
- Sometimes hums old river songs under his breath, especially when drunk
- Will work for a drink, but never asks directly—waits for someone to offer
- Occasionally shows unexpected kindness, sharing a story or a scrap of food with someone worse off

## Role in the Bar

Amos is both a warning and a comfort to the others—a reminder of how far one can fall, and how long one can linger at the bottom. He endures hardship, much of it self-imposed, and resists help out of pride or habit. His suffering is both a warning and a comfort to others.

His actions and presence in the story should reflect the book's philosophy (see philosophy.md), especially endurance, ambiguity, and the quiet impact of small actions.
