# Shopkeeper: Mrs. Ada Bell

## Backstory

Ada Bell has run the general store alone since her husband's death, keeping the doors open through lean years and hard times. She balances the books with care, but the shelves are never as full as she'd like. She is a fixture in the town, respected for her steadiness and quiet generosity.

## Traits

- Stern, practical, with a soft spot for children and strays
- Keeps a thick ledger of debts, but rarely calls them in
- Eyes sharp, voice measured, hands always busy
- Dresses plainly, hair pulled back, apron always dusted with flour
- Knows everyone's business, but keeps her own counsel

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Watches everything from behind the counter, rarely leaving her post
- Offers quiet help to those in need, sometimes slipping an extra loaf of bread or a bit of candy into a bag
- Listens more than she speaks, but when she does, her words carry weight
- Keeps the store running with a mix of barter, credit, and trust
- Her relationship with Brother Calvin is her weak spot—she knows better, but is drawn to him despite herself. It's not clear who is using whom, and she keeps the details to herself, though the town gossips know more than she thinks
- Sometimes found sitting alone in the store after closing, ledger open, lost in thought
- Has a soft spot for the protagonist and others like him, quietly supporting them with the occasional act of charity—an extra loaf, a bit of credit, or a kind word when it's needed most
- Endures hardship, sometimes self-imposed, out of pride and habit. Quietly observes the same in others, offering help when she can, but never forcing it.

## Role in the Story

Ada is the town's quiet center, a source of stability and small kindnesses. Her relationship with the preacher adds complexity to her character, revealing both vulnerability and strength. She is a keeper of secrets, her own and others'

- Her actions and presence in the story should reflect the book's philosophy (see philosophy.md), especially the value and dignity of small kindnesses and the quiet weight of choice.
