# Proprietor: Harlan

## Backstory

Harlan inherited the house from a cousin and turned it into a bar out of necessity, not ambition. He lives in the back room, keeping the place open more out of habit than hope. He has seen better days, but not many, and expects little from the future.

## Traits

- Heavyset, with tired eyes and a slow, deliberate way of moving
- Speaks little, listens more
- Keeps a ledger, though few ever pay
- Tolerates trouble as long as it stays outside
- Keeps a shotgun behind the bar, but has never used it

## Role in the Bar

Harlan is the anchor of the place, holding it together by sheer inertia. He serves, listens, and waits, watching the same faces come and go, year after year.
