# Proprietor: Harlan

## Backstory

Harlan inherited the house from a cousin and turned it into a bar out of necessity, not ambition. He lives in the back room, keeping the place open more out of habit than hope. He has seen better days, but not many, and expects little from the future. More often than not, he is found dozing in a chair or missing altogether, blending in with the regulars until someone needs a drink or a decision made.

## Traits

- Heavyset, with tired eyes and a slow, deliberate way of moving
- Speaks little, listens more
- Keeps a ledger, though few ever pay
- Tolerates trouble as long as it stays outside
- Keeps a shotgun behind the bar, but has never used it
- More like a patron than a proprietor, often absent or asleep
- Fiercely protective of his "bar" and the people who gather there
- Endures hardship by inertia, refusing to change or seek help, and expects others to do the same. His suffering is a fixture of the bar, as much as the regulars themselves.

## Behaviors and Scene Cues

- Can be found asleep in a corner or in the back room, needing to be roused when someone wants a drink
- Grumbles about being inconvenienced, but always gets up to serve when pressed
- Blends in with the regulars, sometimes drinking with them, sometimes just watching
- Responds to trouble with a look or a word, rarely raising his voice
- Lets regulars run tabs, but quietly cuts off those who go too far
- Offers food or a place to sleep to those in real need, but never for free
- Sighs often, especially when the bar is full
- Keeps the peace by presence alone, stepping in only when absolutely necessary
- Has a soft spot for lost causes, though he'd never admit it
- If anyone threatens the bar or its patrons, he becomes unexpectedly forceful and unyielding
- Often asks other patrons to take care of someone passed outâ€”get them home or just out, delegating rather than handling it himself

## Role in the Bar

Harlan is the anchor of the place, holding it together by sheer inertia. He serves, listens, and waits, watching the same faces come and go, year after year. Though he grumbles and seems inconvenienced, he is fiercely protective of his "bar" and those who find refuge there.

His actions and presence in the story should reflect the book's philosophy (see philosophy.md), especially endurance, inertia, and the ambiguity of suffering.
