    <h1>Chapter 1: Monument</h1>
    <p>Gray light seeps through the cracks in the roof. Damp, cool air carries the faint smell of mud and old smoke—the shack breathing with the river. He sits up on the narrow bed, feet finding the splintered floor. Beyond the walls, the world holds its quiet, broken only by a distant train&#39;s call and the slow churn of water against the bank.</p>
<p>Joints stiff from the thin mattress, he moves to the window. The glass is filmed with dust and the memory of rain. Outside, gray dissolves slowly into shapes—the dock, the path, chickens scratching in their endless search. Among them, the rooster struts with chest puffed, though there is little to defend and less to rule.</p>
<p>A tin basin. Cold water. He washes his face, the sting waking him. The water is brown from the well, tasting of iron and earth. He cups it in his hands, drinks, feels it settle in his empty stomach. The mirror above the basin shows a face he recognizes but does not study—stubble, sun-weathered skin, gray eyes.</p>
<p>The stove is cold. He leaves it that way. The chill will pass.</p>
<p>Bread, hard as wood, chewed in silence. He tears it with his teeth, softens it with well water. Three days old, this loaf—bought when Mrs. Ada Bell had marked it down. By evening it will be harder still, but it will last.</p>
<p>Through the window, he watches the chickens scratch in the yard. Their movements are slow, resigned. They find little—a beetle, a seed, scraps of nothing—but they continue. The red hen favors her left leg. Still she scratches. Still she searches.</p>
<p>He takes the coffee tin from the shelf, counts the coins inside. Enough for today. The metal is warm, and the coins make a thin sound when he shakes them. He returns the tin to its place, next to the mason jar of fishhooks and the coil of line that needs mending.</p>
<p>Outside, the air is thick with mist. The grass is wet, the path to the river worn by his own feet. The stones are placed where he placed them, the earth shaped by his passing.</p>
<p>Mist hangs low, blurring the line between water and land. The river runs thick with mud, carrying what it always carries—branches, leaves, the occasional fish swimming belly-up. Upstream, the rain has been heavy. The water is higher today, lapping at the dock&#39;s edge with a sound like whispers.</p>
<p>Across the river, the factory stands empty, windows broken, a hollow shell. Once, men walked those girders, hammered steel, built things that lasted. Now only the frame remains, rusted. The machines were sold, the workers scattered. The building stands as a monument to what was.</p>
<p>Someone moves among the girders—quick, restless, climbing the rusted frame, disappearing, reappearing, a flash of movement in the gray. A figure in the dawn light, moving, always across the river.</p>
<p>The figure is too far to see clearly, but the movement is urgent, purposeful, searching for something in the bones of the old factory. Sometimes the figure stops, becomes still, and seems to look across the water. Sometimes it waves, though whether at him or at someone else, he cannot say.</p>
<p>He does not wave back. </p>
<p>The walk to the dock takes him past the chicken coop, where the birds gather near the fence. The red hen limps forward, hopeful. He reaches into his pocket, finds the crumbs saved from his bread. Hard crumbs, barely worth saving, but the chickens receive them eagerly. The red hen gets most of them.</p>
<p>He checks the nesting boxes. Three eggs, still warm. He lifts them carefully, turns them in his palm. Good shells, no cracks. He slips them into his jacket pocket, cushioned by the worn fabric. Mrs. Ada Bell will give him credit for them, or maybe the proprietor at the bar needs them for the evening meal.</p>
<p>The boards creak under his weight. The river is brown, sluggish, carrying branches and silt from upstream. He kneels, checks the line he left overnight. The hook is bare. The bait is gone—stolen by a turtle, perhaps, or dissolved in the current. He pulls up the line, examines the hook, finds it clean and bright.</p>
<p>From his pocket, he takes the coffee tin with the earthworms. Three worms, fat and dark. He threads one onto the hook, careful not to kill it too quickly. The worm twists, seeking earth that is not there. He casts the line, watches it disappear into the brown water, counts the ripples as they fade.</p>
<p>The river takes what it wants. Sometimes it gives back.</p>
<p>A boat appears through the mist, Reed at the oars. The old man rows with steady strokes, his boat low in the water with the weight of his nets. Their eyes meet across the water. Reed nods, raises one hand briefly from the oar. He nods back. No words pass between them.</p>
<p>Reed&#39;s boat carries the smell of fish and tar, the sound of water against wood. The old man&#39;s face is weathered, his hands cracked from years of rope and net. His boat is older than most, patched and re-patched, but it floats. It holds. It endures. A flask catches the light from beneath the seat, its metal worn smooth by handling.</p>
<p>The boat drifts past, and Reed disappears into the mist. The river carries them both, each in their own direction, each in their own silence.</p>
<p>He remains on the dock, listening to the water, watching the mist thin and rise. Soon the sun will break through, and the day will begin in earnest. The town will wake, children will run to the river, women will hang laundry, men will gather on porches.</p>
<p>He stands, brushes dirt from his knees, and checks the line once more. Still nothing. The hook dangles in the current. He does not reel it in. The river will decide.</p>
<p>Behind him, the chickens have finished their crumbs and returned to their scratching. The red hen still favors her left leg, but she moves with the others. The rooster watches from his perch on the fence post, chest puffed, though the sun has not yet crowned him king of anything.</p>
<p>The mist begins to lift, revealing the far shore, the broken factory, the empty places where people once worked and lived and hoped. The figure is gone now, dissolved into shadow and morning.</p>
<p>He turns from the river, walks the worn path back to the shack. The day stretches ahead, long and familiar. There will be work to do—nets to mend, wood to gather, small repairs that keep the world from falling apart. There will be the store to visit, if the coins stretch far enough. There will be the evening, and the line to check again, and the same brown water carrying the same mysterious cargo downstream.</p>
<p>The train whistle sounds again, distant and mournful. He listens until it fades, then steps inside the shack and closes the door. The latch clicks. The day begins.</p>
<p>Through the window, the river runs on, steady and eternal.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 2: Out of Reach</h1>
    <p>The store sits low to the ground, clapboard faded, windows crowded with hand-lettered signs. Paint peels from the sills. The porch sags under the weight of half-empty seed sacks and weathered crates. A thermometer nailed to the wall reads eighty-five degrees in the shade. Dust hangs in the heavy air, stirred only by the occasional hot breeze that brings the scent of baked earth and fields gone fallow.</p>
<p>The bell above the door chimes softly as he pushes it open, the hinges groaning. Inside, the air is thick with dust and the faint sweetness of molasses. Shelves half-empty. Flour in cloth sacks, their sides soft with age. Penny candy in glass jars, out of reach for most. The jars catch the light from the window, casting small rainbows on the worn wooden counter.</p>
<p>A child stands by the jars, eyes wide, fingers pressed to the glass. She is maybe seven, her dress clean but faded, her shoes scuffed at the toes. The mother hovers nearby, shoulders tense, gaze fixed on the floor. Her hands twist a handkerchief, and she shifts her weight from foot to foot.</p>
<p>Ada stands behind the counter, ledger open, pencil in hand. She nods at his entrance, eyes sharp, hands busy. No words at first. Scarred from years of use, the counter is marked with rings from mason jars and the cuts of countless transactions. Behind her, shelves hold patent medicines, bottles of castor oil, and tins of tobacco.</p>
<p>He reaches into his jacket pocket, careful not to disturb the eggs. The shells are still warm, uncracked. He places them on the counter, one by one, turning them so Ada can see they are good. She lifts each egg, holds it to the light, nods approval.</p>
<p>Ada opens a small notebook, different from the ledger, and makes a mark. Credit for the eggs. She adds numbers in her careful hand, then looks up at him. He points to the bread on the shelf, the coffee, the salt. She nods, reaches for the items, weighs them on the scale. The scale tips, settles. The bread is soft, the coffee ground fine, the salt white as river sand.</p>
<p>She adds a line to the ledger, her writing neat, unhurried. He watches her hand move, the page crowded with names and numbers. The ledger is thick, its pages yellowed, its binding cracked. Every transaction, every debt, every payment recorded in her careful script.</p>
<p>Eli&#39;s name is there, a line of debt that grows and shrinks. The numbers tell a story he cannot read fully, but the pattern is clear. Ada glances at the page, then at him, but says nothing. Her face reveals nothing.</p>
<p>The child has not moved from the candy jars. Her breath fogs the glass, and she wipes it clean with her sleeve. The mother takes a step closer, places a hand on the child&#39;s shoulder. The child points to the peppermint sticks, striped red and white, and the mother shakes her head. The child&#39;s hand falls to her side.</p>
<p>The mother looks at the candy, then at Ada. Ada&#39;s eyes remain on the ledger. The mother waits a moment, then takes the child&#39;s hand. They move toward the door together. The bell above the door chimes as they leave, and their footsteps fade on the wooden porch.</p>
<p>Ada returns to her ledger, makes another mark. She does not look up as the mother and child disappear down the street. The pen remains still against the page.</p>
<p>Through the window, a figure moves down the street. Brother Calvin walks his usual route, his presence felt before he is seen. He does not stop, does not pause, but Ada&#39;s hand stills on the ledger page. She waits, listening, then continues her work. Her movements are more careful now, more deliberate.</p>
<p>He takes his parcel, nods, and steps outside. The sun is higher now, the street empty except for a stray dog panting in the shade. The dog&#39;s ribs show through its coat, and it watches him. He unwraps the bread, breaks off a piece, and drops it near the dog. The dog sniffs, then eats, its tail moving once.</p>
<p>The street is dirt and gravel, rutted from the spring rains. A few chickens scratch in the dust, and a rooster perches on a fence post, watching. From somewhere comes the sound of a hammer on metal, irregular, then stopping. The river moves beyond the trees, its current brown and thick.</p>
<p>He stands for a moment, bread and salt in hand, watching the world continue. Through the dusty window, Ada closes the ledger, sweeps the counter. Her movements are economical, practiced.</p>
<p>A woman stands in the shade by the mill road, arms folded, watching the sky. Her hair is dark, her dress simple, her posture patient. She does not look at him as he passes, but he feels her presence. Mara, maybe, or someone like her. The heat makes faces blur, makes the world shimmer.</p>
<p>He walks past the mill, its wheel turning slow in the shallow water. The wheel is old, its wood green with moss, its iron fittings rusted. The air around it smells of grain and damp wood. The miller is not visible, but the wheel turns, and the stones grind.</p>
<p>The road back to the river is dusty, the trees offering little shade. He shifts the parcel to his other hand, feels the weight of the bread and salt. The coffee will last a week, maybe more. The salt will last longer.</p>
<p>Behind him, the store settles into the afternoon quiet. Ada tends her ledger, sweeps her floor. The dog finds shade and sleeps.</p>
<p>He reaches the path to his shack, the earth worn smooth by his feet. The eggs are gone, traded for what he needs. The river waits, heavy with silt, its current moving toward distant waters. The fishing line hangs in the water, and the day stretches ahead.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="chapter-3" class="chapter">
    <h1>Chapter 3: All Welcome</h1>
    <p>The bell rings, cracked and uncertain, its sound drifting over the rooftops. He hears it from the path toward town, a dull summons that carries across the water. The bell is old, its bronze green with age. He keeps walking, boots scraping the packed dirt, headed for the mill road where work might be found.</p>
<p>The path bends toward the square, dust rising with each step. The church stands at the edge of the square, white paint peeling like old skin, steeple leaning slightly to the left. The building is weathered, its foundation cracked, its windows clouded with years of rain and sun. A sign by the door reads &quot;All Welcome&quot; in faded letters. Morning shadows stretch long across the packed earth, and the air is cool with the promise of heat to come. Cicadas drone in the oak trees, their song rising and falling like breath.</p>
<p>People gather in twos and threes, heads bowed, voices low. Faded but clean, the women wear their best dresses, hair pinned back. The men carry worn Bibles, their shoes polished despite the scuffs. Children fidget beside their parents, tugging at starched collars and ribbon ties.</p>
<p>He slows his pace, then stops, standing apart as Brother Calvin greets each arrival with a practiced smile, collar askew, voice loud in the morning air. Calvin is a big man, thick around the middle, his face flushed with heat and conviction. His handshake is firm, his gaze intense, his words quick and certain. His eyes linger longer on the younger women, the smile deepening just slightly before returning to its practiced warmth.</p>
<p>&quot;Mary, good to see you. Blessed morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tom, how&#39;s the family? The Lord provides.&quot;</p>
<p>The congregation files inside, shoes scraping the steps, hymnals clutched tight. The mother from the store is there, her child beside her, both wearing dresses that have been let out and taken in. As she passes, Ada nods to them, her own dress simple but well-kept.</p>
<p>Inside, the hymns begin—off-key, slow, the words familiar. Through the open door, he catches fragments of song, voices raised in hope or habit. The piano is out of tune, its keys yellow with age, its sound thin in the morning air. The congregation sings with more effort than joy.</p>
<p>Brother Calvin&#39;s voice rises above the rest, calling for prayer. The people bow their heads, some with eyes closed, some with eyes on the floor. Calvin prays for the community, for the harvest, for the souls of those who have strayed. His voice carries through the open door, rich and rolling, practiced in its cadence.</p>
<p>&quot;Lord, we ask for Your blessing on this community, on these faithful souls who gather in Your name. Watch over our neighbors, those who struggle with pride and sin, those who turn away from Your light. Guard us from the temptations that lead us astray, from the paths that divide us from righteousness.&quot;</p>
<p>The words drift out into the morning air, mixing with the sound of insects and the distant call of a train. He leans against the fence, watching the building, listening to the ritual inside. A dog wanders past, sniffing at the church steps, then moving on.</p>
<p>The service continues, Calvin&#39;s voice rising and falling like the tide. He speaks of sin and redemption, of the river&#39;s memory and God&#39;s judgment. The congregation responds with murmurs of agreement, their voices soft and weary. Some shift in their seats, others fan themselves with hymnals. His words drift toward themes of community order, of proper conduct, of the dangers of charity without wisdom.</p>
<p>Through the door, he can see the backs of heads, the bent shoulders of people seeking comfort or answers. The pews are not full, but those who come do so with purpose. Mrs. Ada Bell sits near the front, her back straight, her attention fixed on Calvin&#39;s words. The mother from the store sits near the back, her child beside her, both quiet and still.</p>
<p>A woman weeps quietly on the steps, her shoulders shaking with each sob. Her dress is patched at the elbows, her shoes worn thin. She holds a handkerchief to her face, trying to muffle the sound. She sits alone on the step.</p>
<p>He watches from the fence. The service continues inside, Calvin&#39;s voice steady.</p>
<p>The hymns resume, voices joining in song that speaks of hope and salvation. The melody is familiar, the words worn smooth by repetition. The congregation sings with determination, their voices carrying across the square, past the stores and houses, toward the river.</p>
<p>The sun climbs higher, the bell&#39;s echo fading into memory. The service draws to its close, Calvin&#39;s final prayer echoing through the open door. The people inside begin to stir, gathering their belongings, preparing for the return to their daily lives.</p>
<p>The doors open, and the congregation spills out, blinking in the bright light. They move slowly, reluctantly. Calvin stands at the door, shaking hands, offering final words of encouragement or advice.</p>
<p>&quot;God bless you. Remember what we talked about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next week, then. The Lord&#39;s work continues.&quot;</p>
<p>The people disperse, walking back to their homes, their farms, their daily struggles. The weeping woman has composed herself, clutching her handkerchief. She walks away alone, her steps careful, her head down.</p>
<p>Ada returns to the building, helping to stack hymnals, to straighten pews. She moves with quiet efficiency, her service continuing beyond the formal worship. Calvin moves through the church, closing windows, adjusting chairs. Their paths cross near the altar. A moment of proximity, nothing more, but she steps aside, maintains distance. Her movements remain careful, measured. When a hymnal slips from her hands, she retrieves it quickly, avoiding his eyes. The efficiency masks the tremor in her fingers.</p>
<p>He pushes away from the fence, the square emptying, the church settling back into quiet. The service is over, its echoes lingering in the air.</p>
<p>He turns away, resuming his path, the day moving on. His boots scrape the packed dirt, the dust rising with each step. The path leads past the square, beyond the church, toward the sound of grinding stones and the wheel that turns in the shallow water.</p>
<p>Behind him, the church stands empty, its doors closed, its bell silent. The square is quiet, the morning sun casting long shadows across the dirt. Ahead, the mill waits, its wheel turning in the current.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="chapter-4" class="chapter">
    <h1>Chapter 4: Everything's Gone</h1>
    <p>The wheel turns, slow and deliberate, its wooden spokes dark with water. The mill sits where the creek meets the river, its stone foundation green with moss, its walls weathered gray. The wheel has turned for forty years, grinding grain when there is grain to grind, marking time when there is not.</p>
<p>He walks the path beside the creek, boots squelching in the mud. The miller sometimes has work—heavy sacks, small repairs, tasks that might pay in coins rather than credit. The work comes and goes, depending on the miller&#39;s mood and the season&#39;s demands.</p>
<p>The mill door stands open, flour dust dancing in the morning light. Inside, the great stones turn, their grinding filling the air with a sound like distant thunder. The miller stands beside the mechanism, his thick hands checking the flow of grain, his movements practiced and sure.</p>
<p>&quot;Need something?&quot; the miller asks without looking up. His voice carries over the grinding stones, rough as the grain itself. He is a large man, thick through the chest and shoulders, his hair gray and thinning. His hands are permanently stained with flour, his clothes dusted white.</p>
<p>&quot;Work,&quot; he says. &quot;If there&#39;s any.&quot;</p>
<p>The miller glances at him, considers. &quot;Henderson&#39;s sack needs delivering. And the store.&quot; He jerks his head toward the door. &quot;Cart&#39;s outside.&quot;</p>
<p>The work is simple but heavy. A few sacks wait by the door, each one marked with a name, a weight, a price. He loads them with care, mindful of the flour within. His stomach contracts with emptiness, but his hands remain steady. The miller watches, counting, making marks in a ledger with a stub of pencil.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind the Henderson sack,&quot; the miller says. &quot;They&#39;ll complain either way.&quot;</p>
<p>Mara appears in the doorway that leads to the mill house, her movements careful, deliberate. She carries a tray—bread, cheese, a cup of water. Her dress is simple, faded blue, her hair pulled back severe. She&#39;s perhaps thirty, with the kind of tiredness that comes from years, not days. She sets the tray on the miller&#39;s table without meeting his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;About time,&quot; the miller says, his voice different now. Sharper. &quot;Where&#39;s the butter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gone,&quot; she says quietly. &quot;Used the last yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>The miller&#39;s jaw tightens. &quot;Gone.&quot; He repeats the word like it tastes bad. &quot;Everything&#39;s always gone with you.&quot;</p>
<p>She does not argue, does not explain. She stands beside the table, hands folded, eyes on the floor. The wheel turns, grinding grain, filling the silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Get more,&quot; the miller says. &quot;And mind the cost.&quot;</p>
<p>She nods, turns to go. The miller watches her walk away, his expression unreadable. When she disappears into the house, he returns to his ledger, his pencil moving across the page.</p>
<p>The deliveries are quick—Henderson&#39;s farm, then Ada&#39;s store. Mrs. Henderson checks the sack, counts out payment with careful fingers. Ada runs the flour through her fingers, testing its quality. &quot;Good flour,&quot; she says. &quot;Tell him I said so.&quot;</p>
<p>The return trip is easier, the cart empty. The miller waits, counting coins twice, making marks. &quot;Two bits,&quot; he says, pressing the coins into his palm. &quot;Come back next week. Might have something.&quot;</p>
<p>The coins are cold, few, real. He pockets them, nods, turns to go. In the doorway to the mill house, Mara appears again, her movements careful, strategic. She watches him leave, her expression unreadable. He nods to her, brief but acknowledged. She does not respond, but something in her posture softens.</p>
<p>The path back to the river is quiet, the afternoon light slanting through the trees. Behind him, the mill wheel turns, grinding grain, marking time. The sound fades as he walks, replaced by the whisper of wind through the leaves.</p>
<p>At the river, he stands on the dock, coins in his pocket, the day&#39;s work done. The water moves past, brown and slow, carrying its burden of silt and debris. He checks his fishing line, empty as always, and settles into the familiar rhythm of evening. The coins make a small sound when he moves, a reminder of the day&#39;s work.</p>
<p>Behind him, the mill wheel turns, out of sight but not out of mind, grinding grain and marking time in a world that moves forward regardless of what happens in the shadows, in the quiet spaces between the turning spokes. Night falls, and the world endures.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 5: Silver Flash</h1>
    <p>Mist clings to the water, blurring the far bank. He pushes the boat from the dock, oar dipping, river slow and heavy beneath him. Old, its wood soft with age, the boat&#39;s bottom is scarred and stained. Water seeps through the gaps, pooling around his feet, but it holds. It floats.</p>
<p>The current carries him past the factory—windows broken, walls streaked with rust. The building looms through the mist, its skeleton of steel and iron dark against the gray sky. Laughter rings out, sharp in the morning air, echoing off the water. A figure climbs the girders, quick and fearless, vanishing and reappearing in the mist.</p>
<p>He watches as the figure moves through the structure, leaping from beam to beam. The movements are fluid, confident. The figure pauses at the top, arms spread wide, then disappears into the maze of metal and shadow.</p>
<p>He rows in silence, the river wide and brown, reeds brushing the hull. The water tastes of mud and rain, of upstream storms and downstream mysteries. Cattails bend in the slight breeze, their brown heads heavy with seed. A heron lifts from the shallows, wings beating slow, vanishing into the fog. Its cry echoes across the water, lonely and wild. Dragonflies skim the surface, their wings catching what little light filters through the mist.</p>
<p>The oar cuts through the surface, disturbing the reflection of sky and mist. He drifts, lets the current decide. The world narrows to water, wood, and breath. The river bottom is invisible, lost in brown depths that could be three feet or thirty.</p>
<p>A fish jumps, silver flash in the brown water, then gone. Ripples spread outward, catching the light, then fading. He considers the fishing line coiled in the bottom of the boat, the hooks wrapped in cloth, but does not reach for them. The river will give what it gives. The acceptance he shows the world masks how his stomach contracts with hunger, how his hands want to reach for the line.</p>
<p>Reed appears, boat gliding from the shadows. They pass close, eyes meeting for a moment. No words. His skin is dark from sun and work, his hands scarred from years of labor. He nods, moves on, swallowed by mist.</p>
<p>Reed&#39;s boat leaves a small wake, gentle waves that rock his vessel. The old man&#39;s strokes are steady, efficient. He knows these waters, these currents, these moods of the river.</p>
<p>A figure appears on the riverbank, moving quick and sure. A wave, a flash of hand, then gone, running along the river&#39;s edge. He watches, a line of energy against the gray. The figure moves with purpose, following the water&#39;s edge, disappearing into the trees.</p>
<p>The river moves on, indifferent. A turtle surfaces, head breaking the water, eyes dark and ancient. It watches the boat pass, then sinks back into the depths. The mist begins to lift, revealing more of the far shore, more of the factory&#39;s broken windows.</p>
<p>He lets the boat drift, the oar resting across his knees. The wood is warm from his hands, smooth and worn. The day opens, slow and uncertain, the river carrying him nowhere in particular. A crow calls from the trees, its voice harsh in the morning air.</p>
<p>The factory grows smaller behind him, its broken windows dark. The figure is gone, dissolved back into shadow and steel. The river curves ahead, bending toward unknown shores, carrying him deeper into the morning.</p>
<p>Water laps against the hull, a steady rhythm that matches his breathing. The boat moves with the current, following the river&#39;s path. He does not fight it, does not try to direct its course.</p>
<p>A kingfisher dives, emerging with a fish in its beak. It flies to a dead branch, shakes its catch, then swallows it whole.</p>
<p>The mist thickens, then thins, revealing glimpses of the shore. An old tire hangs from a tree, a rope swing left by children. A dock extends into the water, its boards green with moss. Life continues along the river&#39;s edge, marked by small signs of human presence.</p>
<p>He passes a sandbar, its surface dotted with the tracks of raccoons and possums. The water is shallower here, clearer, revealing the bottom strewn with rocks and fallen branches. A snake sunbathes on a log, its scales catching the filtered light.</p>
<p>The boat drifts on, following the river&#39;s lazy curve. He sits in the stern, oar across his knees, watching the world pass by. The water carries him forward, toward whatever the day will bring.</p>
<p>Behind him, the factory disappears into the mist, its mysteries intact. The figure is gone, but their energy remains in the disturbed air, in the echo of laughter off the water.</p>
<p>The river stretches ahead, murky and wide, thick with fallen branches and yesterday&#39;s rain. He drifts with it, following the water&#39;s course.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 6: My Chair</h1>
    <p>The house sags at the edge of town, porch littered with bottles and broken chairs. The paint is gone, leaving weathered wood gray and worn. A sign hangs crooked by the door, letters too faded to read. He doesn&#39;t mean to go in. The cold drives him toward the light spilling from the windows, toward the sound of voices and the promise of warmth. Wind cuts through his thin jacket, carrying the bite of winter and the scent of wood smoke from distant chimneys.</p>
<p>Eli is ahead, hands in her pockets, shoulders hunched against the wind. She moves with purpose, her steps quick on the broken porch boards. She glances back once, waits at the door. He follows, not thinking, just moving out of the cold.</p>
<p>Inside, the air is thick with sweat and cheap spirits. The smell hits him first—stale beer, unwashed bodies, smoke from cigarettes rolled too thin. Floorboards creak under his weight, sticky with spilled drinks. A single bulb hangs from the ceiling, casting harsh shadows that make faces hard to read.</p>
<p>In the corner, Lila sits with faded dress hanging loose on her thin frame, suitcase at her feet, humming to herself. Her hair is unwashed, her eyes unfocused. The suitcase is old, its leather cracked, its brass fittings tarnished. She rocks slightly as she hums. When Harlan&#39;s not looking, her eyes sharpen, tracking who enters, who leaves, who has money. The vacant humming resumes the moment his attention returns.</p>
<p>Hunched at the bar, Amos mutters with eyes on the floor. His clothes are stained, his beard unkempt. His fingers wrap around a mug, knuckles white with the effort of holding on. He speaks to no one, his words lost in the noise of the room. A wedding ring, bright with polish, catches the light on his finger—the only clean thing about him. When someone approaches, his muttering stops, replaced by sullen silence. The words return only when he thinks himself unheard.</p>
<p>Behind the counter, Harlan sleeps, roused only when someone calls his name. The proprietor is a big man gone soft, his belly straining against his shirt. His face is flushed, his breathing heavy. A bottle sits open beside him, its contents half-gone. Beneath the counter, his hand rests on a ledger, neat columns of numbers tracked in careful script.</p>
<p>&quot;Late,&quot; Amos mutters, not looking up. His voice is slurred, his words directed at the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Always,&quot; Lila echoes, voice flat. She continues humming, the melody broken and strange.</p>
<p>Harlan grunts, half-awake. &quot;Always comes.&quot; His eyes focus briefly on the man at the end of the bar, then drift away.</p>
<p>The words drift through the room, worn smooth by repetition. No one expects an answer. He moves to the bar, finds an empty stool at the far end. The wood is worn smooth, stained with rings from countless glasses. He sits carefully, back to the wall, watching the room.</p>
<p>A man slumps at a table near the door, head in his hands. His shoulders shake with each breath. A bottle sits empty before him, its label peeled away. His clothes are clean but wrinkled, his shoes polished but worn. He looks up once, eyes red, then returns to staring at the table.</p>
<p>Lila laughs, sharp and sudden, breaking the hush. The sound cuts through the room. Amos grumbles, knocks over his mug, curses the world. Beer spreads across the bar, dripping onto the floor. Harlan stirs, looks at the mess, then settles back into sleep.</p>
<p>A shadow moves near the door, quick and restless. Perhaps someone entering, perhaps someone leaving. The light shifts, and the shadow is gone. The room feels different for a moment, charged with a restless energy, then settles back into its familiar rhythm.</p>
<p>Amos slides a glass across the bar, liquid dark and nameless. The glass is chipped, its surface cloudy with age. He drinks, the taste sharp, unfamiliar. The alcohol burns his throat, settles hot in his stomach. He does not ask what it is, does not question the price.</p>
<p>Another man enters, moves toward the table by the door. The miller looks up from his drink, flour still dusting his sleeves. &quot;My chair,&quot; he says, voice rough with drink and the day&#39;s frustrations. The newcomer sits anyway. A shove, a chair scraping. The miller grabs at the man&#39;s shirt, thick hands used to controlling mill machinery now trying to control flesh. They stumble near the entrance.</p>
<p>Harlan wakes, sighs. &quot;Outside,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Lila sings a line of an old song. &quot;Down in the valley, the valley so low.&quot;</p>
<p>The fight winds down, both men too tired to continue. The miller retreats to the bar, muttering about respect and people taking what isn&#39;t theirs. The other man finds a different corner, nursing a split lip.</p>
<p>Another glass appears, pushed his way without comment. He drinks again, the burn settling in his chest. The room grows warmer, or perhaps the alcohol makes it seem so. Conversations resume, quiet and broken.</p>
<p>A woman enters, her coat soaked through, her shoes squelching on the floor. She looks around, finds no welcome, and leaves again. The door slams behind her, shaking the windows. Harlan mutters something about keeping the cold out, then returns to his bottle.</p>
<p>He watches it all, saying nothing. The room is full of people who have nowhere else to go, nothing else to do. They drink because it helps, or because it doesn&#39;t matter, or because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>Time passes. The glasses multiply, empty and forgotten. Lila&#39;s humming grows louder, more discordant. Amos continues his muttered conversation with the floor. The man by the door returns to his weeping. Others come and go, faces blurred by alcohol and shadow.</p>
<p>He leaves before dark, the sound of laughter and argument fading behind him. The cold air hits him, clearing his head, sharpening his vision. Above, clouds gather thick and heavy. The river flows unchanged, its current moving steady and sure toward the sea.</p>
<p>Behind him, the bar continues its nightly ritual. The lights burn dim, the voices carry on, and the bottles empty one by one.</p>

  <section id="chapter-7" class="chapter">
    <h1>Chapter 7: Design</h1>
    <p>Rain falls hard, drumming on the tin roofs. The sky opens without warning, releasing water in sheets that blur the world into gray shapes. He is caught between the mill and the river, no shelter but the trees that offer little protection from the downpour.</p>
<p>The storm comes sudden, after the day&#39;s heat. The air had been thick and still, pressing down like a weight. Now it breaks, releasing its burden in torrents that turn the dust to mud, the paths to streams. Lightning flashes in the distance, followed by thunder that rolls across the water.</p>
<p>He runs for the shed behind the mill, his boots slipping on the wet earth. The structure is old, its walls weathered, its roof patched with sheets of tin that sing under the rain&#39;s assault. The door hangs crooked on its hinges, creaking in the wind.</p>
<p>Inside, darkness thick, air heavy with the smell of wet earth and oil. The shed is cramped, filled with machinery—rusted gears, broken tools, lengths of chain that catch what little light filters through the gaps in the walls. Water drips through the roof in places, pooling on the dirt floor.</p>
<p>Mara is already there, sitting on a wooden crate, arms folded, eyes on the door. She nods when he enters, makes room without speaking. Her hair is damp, her dress clinging to her frame. She glances briefly toward the mill house through the gaps in the walls, then settles back. A small canvas bag sits beside her, carefully positioned away from the dripping water.</p>
<p>Outside, the rain continues its assault. The mill wheel creaks and groans, turned by the swollen stream. Lightning flashes, the world white for a moment, revealing the shed&#39;s contents in stark detail—the rust, the decay, the remnants of work once done.</p>
<p>They sit in silence, listening to the storm. The air is close, humid, filled with the scent of rain and earth and something else—the metallic smell of old machinery, the mustiness of a place long unused. A rat scurries across the floor, disappearing into the shadows.</p>
<p>Thunder rolls overhead, shaking the tin roof. She shifts on the crate, her movements careful, economical. He leans against the wall, feeling the rough wood against his back. The storm shows no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>She stands, moves closer, her movements practical, unhurried. No words pass between them. He does not resist, does not question. She has timed this as carefully as her appearances in doorways, her strategic movements through the mill house. </p>
<p>The rain continues, masking sound. Lightning flashes again, throwing their shadows against the walls. The storm is the only witness.</p>
<p>After, she dresses without looking at him, her movements efficient, matter-of-fact. He buttons his shirt, stares at the floor. The rain slows to a steady patter, then to scattered drops. The storm is passing, leaving the world washed and clean.</p>
<p>She stands, smooths her dress, checks the door. The wind has died down, and the thunder has moved on. She leaves first, slipping into the night without a backward glance, without a word of farewell. The door closes behind her with a soft click.</p>
<p>He waits, listens to the last drops on the roof, counts the seconds between lightning and thunder. The storm is moving away, taking its energy with it. The air is cooler now, cleaner, carrying the scent of rain-washed earth.</p>
<p>He steps out into the wet grass. The world is unchanged. The mill wheel still turns, the river still runs, unseen in the dark. Puddles reflect the sky, and the air tastes of rain and the promise of morning.</p>
<p>The path back to his shack is muddy, treacherous in the darkness. He walks carefully, feeling his way, his boots squelching in the wet earth. The storm has passed, leaving only the memory of its violence and the smell of clean air.</p>
<p>Behind him, the shed settles back into silence. The machinery rusts, the rain drips through the roof, and the world continues its slow turn toward dawn.</p>
<p>The river waits, brown and swollen with rain, carrying the storm&#39;s runoff toward the sea. The night is quiet except for the drip of water from the trees, the distant call of a night bird, the soft whisper of the current against the bank.</p>
<p>He reaches his shack, pushes open the door, steps inside. The familiar smell of old wood and river air greets him. The storm has passed, and the world has returned to its usual rhythm. He lies down on the narrow bed, listens to the rain&#39;s last drops on the roof, and waits for sleep to come.</p>
<p>Outside, the night continues. The mill wheel turns, the river flows, and the world endures. The storm has washed the air clean, leaving the morning fresh and cool. The river still runs toward the sea, and the night still holds its secrets.</p>

  <section id="chapter-8" class="chapter">
    <h1>Chapter 8: Always Down</h1>
    <p>Dawn breaks slow and gray, the street empty, the church steps slick with dew. The air is cool, carrying the scent of wet earth and river mist. Frost edges the grass, and his breath clouds white in the morning chill. The sound of his footsteps echoes off the empty buildings. He walks the path toward the square, bread in hand—yesterday&#39;s loaf, hard but edible.</p>
<p>A man sits on the church steps, coat damp, boots muddy, hands wrapped around his knees. He is older, his hair gray and unkempt, his face weathered by sun and wind. A canvas bag sits beside him, worn thin at the corners. He rocks slightly as he sits, his eyes fixed on the empty street.</p>
<p>He slows, nods. The man nods back, offers a seat with a gesture of his hand. No words at first, just the quiet of the morning and the sound of birds stirring in the trees. The stone steps are cold and wet, but he sits, keeping distance between them.</p>
<p>The stranger speaks, his voice soft, almost lost in the morning air. Something about the river, about letting go. The words are simple, unadorned, but they carry weight. He speaks of water that remembers, of things that must be released to find peace. His accent is unfamiliar, his cadence measured. His fingers worry at a worn photograph in his coat pocket, edges soft from handling.</p>
<p>&quot;River knows,&quot; the man says. &quot;Knows what we can&#39;t bear to know ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>The words linger in the air, settling like mist. He listens without responding, watching the stranger&#39;s face, noting the lines around his eyes, the way his hands shake slightly in the morning cold.</p>
<p>A shadow moves at the edge of the square—perhaps someone familiar, perhaps not. The figure lingers by the miller&#39;s fence, barely visible in the morning light. A shift in the shadows, a suggestion of movement, then stillness. The morning light plays tricks with the eye.</p>
<p>The church door opens with a creak. Ada steps out, a cup in her hand, steam rising from the hot liquid. She pauses when she sees the stranger, her expression unreadable. She moves down the steps, her footsteps careful on the wet stone.</p>
<p>She sets the cup beside the stranger, says nothing for a moment. The steam rises between them, carrying the scent of coffee and warmth. Then, quietly, &quot;Here you are, Josiah.&quot; Her voice is gentle, familiar.</p>
<p>The man—Josiah—looks up, his eyes meeting hers. He wraps his hands around the cup, lets the warmth seep into his fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Ada,&quot; he says. His voice is stronger now, more present. &quot;Kind to an old fool.&quot;</p>
<p>She shakes her head, dismissing the comment. &quot;Coffee&#39;s not much. But it&#39;s hot.&quot;</p>
<p>Brother Calvin appears at the church window, his figure visible through the glass. He observes the scene below, then steps back into the shadows. His presence lingers even when he is no longer visible.</p>
<p>Ada ignores the watching eyes, settling herself on the step beside Josiah. She does not speak, but her presence is a comfort. The morning grows lighter, and the town begins to stir. A rooster crows in the distance, and smoke rises from a chimney across the square.</p>
<p>Ada glances at the worn soles of his boots, the frayed edges of his coat. &quot;Long way from anywhere,&quot; she says quietly.</p>
<p>Josiah nods, hands wrapped around the cup. &quot;Long enough.&quot;</p>
<p>He watches the exchange, noting the ease between them, the way Ada&#39;s kindness flows naturally, without expectation.</p>
<p>A child runs past, chasing a dog. The dog barks, tail wagging, and the child laughs. The sound carries across the square, bright and clear. Josiah smiles, the first genuine expression he has seen from him.</p>
<p>The town stirs. Doors open, shutters creak. Ada watches people emerge from their houses.</p>
<p>&quot;Keeps going,&quot; Josiah says, more to himself than to her.</p>
<p>Brother Calvin&#39;s figure disappears from the window. The church itself seems to watch, its windows dark, its silence heavy. Ada continues her conversation with Josiah, but something has changed in her posture, a subtle stiffness in her shoulders. Her kindness remains genuine, but her words become more careful, more measured. She serves others while serving Calvin&#39;s judgment of her goodness.</p>
<p>The shadow at the edge of the square flickers again, like something half-remembered. A movement in the periphery, there and gone. Josiah&#39;s eyes drift toward the spot, and he speaks softly to the morning air. &quot;River&#39;s not the only thing that remembers.&quot;</p>
<p>He watches this careful space, the way Ada and Josiah exist in their quiet moment.</p>
<p>The town moves on, the day unfolding. People emerge from their houses, beginning their morning routines. The baker opens his shop, the miller starts his wheel, and the sound of daily life fills the air. But the small group on the church steps remains apart, existing in their own quiet space.</p>
<p>Josiah finishes his coffee, sets the cup down beside him. He stands, shouldering his canvas bag, preparing to leave. Ada rises too, taking the empty cup without comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Where to?&quot; she asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Down the river,&quot; he says. &quot;Always down.&quot;</p>
<p>He looks at the man beside him, their eyes meeting for a moment. &quot;River&#39;s calling,&quot; he says. &quot;Best to listen when it does.&quot;</p>
<p>He nods. Josiah looks toward where Eli sits, silent as shadow. He speaks to the morning, his words carrying on the air. &quot;River&#39;s not the only thing that remembers.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, he walks away, his boots squelching in the mud. He disappears down the road that leads to the river, his figure growing smaller until it is lost in the morning haze.</p>
<p>Ada watches him go. She turns to him, but then thinks better of it. Instead, she nods and returns to the church, the empty cup in her hand.</p>
<p>He stands, brushes the dampness from his clothes, and continues his walk through the town. Behind him, the church steps are empty again, marked only by the wet imprint of where two people shared a moment of quiet understanding.</p>
<p>The river moves beyond the trees, restless and deep. The day has begun, and the town wakes. The stranger&#39;s words linger in the morning air.</p>

  <section id="chapter-9" class="chapter">
    <h1>Chapter 9: Gathering Darkness</h1>
    <p>Evening settles over the town, the store nearly bare. The last light of autumn fades through the windows, painting everything amber and gold. Shelves stripped, only dust and a few sacks left. The glass jars are empty, their lids removed. Lamps burn low, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. Outside, the temperature drops with the sun, and the first hint of winter rides the evening breeze.</p>
<p>Ada sweeps methodically, her movements slower than usual. The ledger lies closed on the counter, its pages thick with entries. Her hands are slow, eyes dull with fatigue. Lines have appeared around her mouth, and her shoulders sag.</p>
<p>The bell above the door chimes softly as he enters, hat in hand, eyes on the shelves—less there than before. Gaps where goods should be. The flour sacks are fewer, the shelves of patent medicines nearly empty. The store echoes with emptiness.</p>
<p>Ada looks up from her sweeping, nods without smiling. She moves to the counter, waiting. Her dress is clean but faded, her apron stained with the day&#39;s work. The lamp light catches the silver in her hair, making her look older than her years.</p>
<p>He points to the coffee tin on the shelf, then to the salt. She nods, understanding.</p>
<p>She moves to the shelves, gathering what little remains. The coffee tin is light in her hands, the salt bag half-empty. She weighs them carefully, her movements precise despite her weariness. The scale tips, settles, and she makes a note in her small notebook—not the ledger, but the one for credit.</p>
<p>No words pass between them. The silence is comfortable, familiar. Ada wraps his purchases in brown paper, her fingers working with practiced efficiency. The store creaks around them, settling into the evening quiet.</p>
<p>A child appears at the door, thin and silent. She is perhaps eight years old, her dress too large, her shoes held together with string. Her eyes are wide with hunger, her face pale with want. She does not speak, but her presence fills the doorway.</p>
<p>Ada glances at the child, then at her dwindling supplies. Without hesitation, she slips a loaf of bread into a bag, adds a small piece of cheese, and hands it over without a word. The child&#39;s eyes widen. Ada&#39;s hands shake slightly.</p>
<p>The child clutches the bag. She looks up at Ada, mouth opening as if to speak, then closes it again. A nod, a step backward.</p>
<p>Ada gestures gently toward the door, her expression soft but firm. The child understands.</p>
<p>She disappears into the evening shadows. Ada returns to her sweeping, her movements more deliberate now.</p>
<p>Through the window, Eli stands outside, arms crossed, pride holding her back from stepping inside. She watches the exchange, her face unreadable. He sees her there, a figure caught between need and independence, between hunger and dignity.</p>
<p>He reaches into his pocket, pulls out more coins than his purchase requires. The miller&#39;s two bits, once cold in his palm, now warm from his body, worn smooth by countless hands. He leaves them on the counter and pushes them toward Ada.</p>
<p>Ada looks at the coins, then at him. She lets them sit for a moment, then, with a small nod, she sweeps them into the drawer. The sound of metal against wood echoes in the empty store.</p>
<p>He takes his package, and moves toward the door. The bell chimes again as he steps outside, the sound fading into the evening air. Behind him, Ada continues her sweeping, preparing to close the store for another day.</p>
<p>The street is empty, lit only by the warm glow spilling from windows. A dog wanders past, sniffing at the ground, searching for scraps. The air is cool, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant river.</p>
<p>He walks home, bread under his arm, the river dark beside him. The water moves silently, its surface reflecting the last light of day. Crickets begin their evening chorus, and somewhere in the distance, a train whistle calls across the water.</p>
<p>At the edge of his yard, he pauses. The old crate by the fence sits empty, weathered by rain and sun. He sets his bag down on the crate, careful to keep the bread dry. Inside the bag, he leaves most of his purchases—the coffee, the salt.</p>
<p>Eli&#39;s shadow lingers nearby, a darker shape against the evening sky. She watches from the trees, her body tense, ready to flee if discovered. Pride keeps her at a distance, but necessity will bring her closer once he is gone.</p>
<p>He turns away, walks to his shack, and closes the door behind him. The latch clicks softly, and the evening settles into its familiar rhythm. Through the window, he can see the crate by the fence, the bag waiting in the gathering darkness.</p>
<p>The river flows past, dark and silent. The town sleeps. The night is kind to those who know how to move in shadows, how to take what is offered without being seen.</p>
<p>He lies on his narrow bed, listening to the sound of water against the bank. Outside, the night settles deeper, and the crate waits by the fence. Somewhere across the water, a lantern flickers—Reed&#39;s boat moving in the darkness.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="chapter-10" class="chapter">
    <h1>Chapter 10: Ghost-Like</h1>
    <p>Night falls heavy, the river black and wide. Stars pierce the darkness above, their light scattered on the water&#39;s surface. The air is sharp with the promise of frost, and bare branches rattle in the wind. He stands on the dock, lantern in hand, breath clouding in the cool air. The dock creaks beneath his weight, old wood settling into the night.</p>
<p>The air is thick with mist, carrying the scent of mud and rotting vegetation. Somewhere in the distance, a night bird calls. The river moves silently, its current invisible in the darkness, marked only by the occasional drift of leaves and debris.</p>
<p>Reed&#39;s boat glides out of the darkness, silent as a shadow. The old man&#39;s oars dip slow and steady, barely disturbing the water. His expression is calm and patient, his movements economical. The boat appears ghost-like in the lantern light, its hull black against the water.</p>
<p>Reed gestures with a tilt of his head, and he steps into the boat. The vessel rocks beneath him, finding its new balance. The wooden seat is smooth and cold. Reed pushes off with his oar, and they slip away from the dock into the black water.</p>
<p>They cross in silence, water lapping against the hull in a steady rhythm. The lantern casts a small circle of light around them, beyond which the world disappears into darkness. The river stretches wide here, its far bank lost in shadow and mist.</p>
<p>Reed rows with practiced ease, his oars cutting the water cleanly. His breathing is steady, unhurried. He knows these waters, these currents, these hidden dangers. The boat moves through the darkness, guided by sure movements.</p>
<p>The far bank looms gradually out of the darkness, trees tangled, shadows deep. Something waits there, small and indistinct in the mist. The shape might be a person, might be a stump, might be nothing at all. The lantern light catches something—movement, or perhaps just the play of shadows on water.</p>
<p>Reed rows toward the bank, his oars steady. The boat slides up to the muddy shore with a soft scrape. Whatever waits does not move. In the uncertain light, it could be anyone, anything, or no one at all.</p>
<p>He steps onto the bank, feet sinking into the soft mud. The lantern casts its circle of light, but beyond its reach, the darkness holds its secrets. A sound from the shadows—footsteps, perhaps, or the wind through the reeds. Something moves in the periphery of vision.</p>
<p>Reed pushes off from the bank, the boat rocking as it slips back into the current. He settles into the stern, and Reed turns the bow downstream. The old man rows steadily, carrying them both deeper into the night. The smell of spirits drifts faintly in the air between them, but Reed&#39;s hands remain steady on the oars.</p>
<p>The boat drifts past a fallen tree, its branches reaching into the water. An owl calls from somewhere in the darkness, answered by another from across the river. The night is alive with small sounds—the plop of a turtle sliding from a log, the rustle of something moving through the reeds.</p>
<p>Reed&#39;s oars cut through patches of foam and floating debris. The river carries its cargo downstream—leaves, branches, the occasional bottle or piece of cloth. All of it moves together in the darkness, part of the river&#39;s endless journey to the sea.</p>
<p>They pass under a low bridge, its stone arches dark against the sky. The sound of their passage echoes briefly, then fades. Above them, the road crosses empty and silent.</p>
<p>A sound drifts across the water—perhaps humming, perhaps only the river&#39;s voice rising and falling. The melody is strange, unfamiliar, like wind through reeds. Sometimes it stops, leaving only the water&#39;s murmur, then begins again. The source is uncertain, somewhere in the darkness.</p>
<p>The lantern flickers, its flame dancing in the night breeze. Shadows shift and move, playing tricks with the eye. He watches Reed, watches the water flow past. He speaks no words, asks no questions. The journey is enough.</p>
<p>They round a bend, and a spit of sand appears in the lantern light. Reed steers toward it, his oars guiding the boat through the shallow water. The sand is pale and fine, unmarked except by the tracks of raccoons and possums.</p>
<p>Nothing waits there but driftwood and the smell of mud. The shore is littered with river trash—bleached logs, plastic bottles, tangles of fishing line. The sand gives way to marsh grass, then to the dark line of trees beyond.</p>
<p>A splash from the shallows, sudden and quick. Footsteps, perhaps, or a night animal disturbed. The sound fades into the marsh grass, and the darkness swallows whatever made it.</p>
<p>Reed nods to him. He pushes off from the sand, the boat rocking as it slips back into the current. The old man turns the bow downstream, his oars finding their rhythm again.</p>
<p>He remains in the boat, settling into the stern. Reed rows steadily, carrying them both deeper into the night. The lantern light grows smaller, more fragile against the vast darkness of the river.</p>
<p>Behind them, the spit of sand disappears into shadow. Ahead, the river stretches endlessly, carrying them toward unknown shores. The night is thick around them, full of secrets and silence, and the world remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Water laps against the hull, a steady sound. Reed rows on, tireless, his face calm in the lantern light. He watches the darkness flow past, content to be carried by the current, by the night, by the patient water. In the distance, the first hint of dawn touches the horizon.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 11: Ancient Turning</h1>
    <p>Dusk settles over the river, the water gold and gray. He sits on the dock, feet dangling above the surface, watching the light change. The world is quiet except for the call of a distant bird, its voice carrying across the water.</p>
<p>The shack behind him stands dark, its windows reflecting the evening sky. The stove is cold, its ashes settled. The bed waits, narrow and familiar. On the table, bread and salt sit untouched, provisions for tomorrow or whenever hunger calls.</p>
<p>A train whistle sounds in the distance, mournful and distant. The sound drifts across the water, then fades, leaving only the soft lap of waves against the dock. A fish jumps, rings spreading outward, then disappearing into the current.</p>
<p>He watches the sun slip behind the empty factory across the river. The building stands silhouetted against the darkening sky, its broken windows dark. The girders are empty now, no figures climbing through the ruins. Even the restless have found their rest.</p>
<p>The sky bruises purple and orange, clouds catching the last light. Swallows dive for insects above the water, their cries sharp in the evening air. A heron stands motionless in the shallows, waiting for the unwary fish.</p>
<p>The river moves, slow and indifferent, carrying branches, leaves, the debris of the day. A bottle bobs past, then a piece of wood worn smooth by water. All of it flows downstream, toward the sea, part of the river&#39;s endless cargo.</p>
<p>The air cools, carrying the scent of mud and growing things. The smell of wood smoke drifts from the town&#39;s chimneys, mixing with the earthy dampness of the riverside. Fireflies begin to blink in the grass, their lights scattered like fallen stars. A dog barks somewhere in the town, then falls silent. The wind picks up, rustling the dry leaves that cling to the cottonwood trees.</p>
<p>He stands, brushes dirt from his pants, listens to the hush that settles over the water. The dock creaks beneath his feet, old wood adjusting to the evening temperature. He checks the fishing line one more time—still empty, hook clean and waiting.</p>
<p>The path to the shack is worn smooth, the earth shaped by his steps. He walks slowly, in no hurry to reach the door. The evening is peaceful, full of small sounds and settling shadows.</p>
<p>Inside, the shack smells of old wood and river air. He lights the lamp, its flame casting dancing shadows on the walls. The mirror above the basin reflects his face—stubble, weathered skin, gray eyes. Cold water against his face as he washes.</p>
<p>The coffee tin sits on the shelf, coins making their thin sound when he counts them. Enough for tomorrow. Fishhooks and line fill the mason jar, tools of his trade. The coil of net waits for mending, its gaps patient for his attention.</p>
<p>He moves to the window, looks out at the river. The water is dark now, its surface barely visible in the gathering night. Stars begin to appear, first one, then many, their light scattered on the current. The factory is a dark shape against the sky, its mysteries intact.</p>
<p>Somewhere across the water, a light flickers. The light wavers, then disappears, swallowed by the darkness.</p>
<p>He sits on the edge of the bed, removes his boots, sets them beside the door. Cool beneath his feet, the floor. Outside, the river continues its flow, carrying debris downstream.</p>
<p>An owl calls from the trees, answered by another from across the water. Night hunters begin their work. The world settles into its nocturnal rhythm.</p>
<p>He lies down on the narrow bed, pulls the thin blanket over him. The pillow is flat, the mattress hard, but they are familiar, comfortable in their simplicity. Through the window, he can see stars reflected on the water, points of light in the vast darkness.</p>
<p>The river breathes in the dark, rising and falling with each small wave. Somewhere, a night bird calls. Somewhere, the train moves through the darkness, its whistle fading into distance. Somewhere, the world continues its ancient turning.</p>
<p>He closes his eyes, listens to the water against the bank. The sound is steady, familiar, constant.</p>
<p>Night deepens. The river flows on, its surface broken by the occasional fish.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the fishing line hangs in the current, patient and still. The chickens roost in their coop, the red hen favoring her left leg. The town sleeps, its people dreaming.</p>
<p>The shack settles into the night, its occupant breathing slow and steady. Outside, the river runs on, endless and unchanging.</p>
