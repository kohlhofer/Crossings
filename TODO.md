# TODO / Tasks

## COMPLETED
- [x] make chapter 7 foreshadow chapter 9 and 10 (DONE: Josiah's "down the river" talk and "River's calling" adequately foreshadow night crossing and ending)
- [x] make things more implicit, e.g. "A nod, an invitation. Reed gestures with a tilt of his head, and he steps into the boat." - it is clear that this is an invitation, no? fix all instances of this. (FIXED: removed over-explanatory language from Chapters 2, 7, and 9)
- [x] there is too much details to lead up to the bar fight. it should feel like mundane and pointless. (FIXED: streamlined fight to be more abrupt and mundane)
- [x] Ada is too good. remove acts of kindness (not the one towards josiah)? Also here vice is the secret affair with Calvin. Can he pose a subtle intrusion on her in other chapters? e.g. outside the shop? She does not like that about herself. (FIXED: removed excessive kindness, added Calvin tension showing their affair)
- [x] Reed's boat is described in chapter 1.. and again in a later chapter which feels redundant or does not add anything. (FIXED: reduced redundancy in Chapters 4 and 9, varied descriptions)
- [x] Remove remaining over-explanatory language (like "A nod, an invitation") (FIXED: removed "as if" phrases and interpretive commentary across 8 chapters)
- [x] Check for any remaining internal consistency issues (FIXED: found and corrected Chapter 8 bread contradiction, verified weather/time flow)
- [x] Remove any remaining judgmental/interpretive language (FIXED: removed hollow, lonely, private, forgotten, abandoned, lost in darkness across 6 chapters)
- [x] Make Eli's mysterious nature more consistent (she's too present in some scenes)
- [x] Develop Brother Calvin's disapproval more subtly across chapters
- [x] Vary sentence structure more - some paragraphs have too similar rhythm
- [x] Add character flaws/complexity - most characters are too one-dimensional
- [x] Add more tension between characters' public/private selves
- [x] Reduce repetitive descriptions (Reed's boat, river descriptions, etc.)
- [x] Tighten dialogue - some conversations feel slightly artificial
- [x] Improve transitions between chapters - some feel disconnected

## IN PROGRESS  
- [x] Add more environmental/atmospheric details to vary the setting
