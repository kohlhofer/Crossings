# TODO / Tasks

- [ ] make chapter 7 foreshadow chapter 9 and 10.. 
- [ ] Ada is too good. remove  acts of kindness (not the one towards josiah)? Also here vice is the secret affair with Calvin. Can he pose a asublte intrusion on her in other capters? e.g. outside the shop? She does not like that about herself.
- [ ] make things more implicit, e.g. "A nod, an invitation. Reed gestures with a tilt of his head, and he steps into the boat." - it is clear that this is an inviation, no? fix all instances of this. 
- [ ] there is too much details to lead up to the bar fight. it should feel like mindaine and pointless. 
- [ ] Reed's boat is described in chapter 1.. and again in a later chapter which feels redundent or does not add anything.
