# The Church

## Description

A sagging wooden structure at the edge of town, its white paint peeling and its steeple leaning slightly to one side. The bell is cracked, ringing with a dull, uncertain sound. Inside, the pews are mismatched and creak under the weight of the congregation. The windows are patched with cardboard and old newspaper where glass is missing. The preacher does his best to keep the place looking proper—fresh flowers on the altar, a swept floor—but the poverty of the town is everywhere.

## Atmosphere

The church is a place of ritual and habit, more than faith. Services are held on Sundays and whenever the preacher can gather a crowd. The air is thick with dust, the hymns sung off-key, the prayers recited by rote. For some, it is a refuge; for others, an obligation. The preacher's voice carries through the thin walls, promising salvation, but the promise feels as worn as the hymnals.
