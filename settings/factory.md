# The Abandoned Factory

## Description

A hulking, derelict structure at the edge of the river, its windows broken and its roof sagging. Rusted machinery and debris litter the grounds. The walls are covered in peeling paint and faded signs from a time when the factory was the town's hope for prosperity.

Inside, the air is thick with dust and the smell of oil and mildew. Rain leaks through the roof, pooling on the cracked concrete floor. Makeshift beds and piles of scavenged blankets mark the corners where a handful of hopeless sorts, including Eli, have made their shelter. Rats and stray cats move in the shadows.

## Atmosphere

The factory is a place of last resort, a shelter for those with nowhere else to go. It is unsafe, cold in winter, stifling in summer, and always on the verge of collapse. Yet, for some, it offers a kind of freedomâ€”no rules, no expectations, just survival. The river is visible through the broken windows, a reminder of the world outside and the cycles that continue beyond the factory walls.
