# The Outskirts Home

## Description

A small, weather-beaten shack stands at the edge of the woods, where the land slopes down toward the river. The path to town is little more than a track through tall grass and brambles, often muddy after rain. The house is patched with tin and driftwood, its porch sagging, a single rocking chair facing the water. Chickens scratch in the dirt yard, and a battered rowboat is pulled up on the bank, half-hidden by reeds.

Here, poverty is sharper than elsewhere. The roof leaks, the woodstove is old and temperamental, and the shelves are never quite full. The air smells of smoke, river mud, and old paper. A faded photograph sits on the windowsill, its subject indistinct. The home is more precarious and isolated than most, a place for those with nowhere else to go. He keeps to himself, venturing into town only when necessary, his presence noted but rarely remarked upon.

## Atmosphere

The place feels suspended between worldsâ€”neither fully part of the town nor entirely apart from it. The river is closer here, its sounds constant: the slap of water against the dock, the call of night birds, the distant hum of insects. At dawn, mist drifts through the trees, blurring the line between land and water, past and present.
